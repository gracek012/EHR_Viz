As you are well aware, he is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of nonallergic rhinosinusitis status post sinus surgeries, history of nephrolithiasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a history of prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy, who is now being seen in the Stanford Chest Clinic for abnormal CT findings concerning for a necrotizing pneumonia. He has been referred to us as an outpatient for this issue.     Mr. Shertzer states that through the majority of his later life he has had issues with recurrent sinusitis, cough, bronchitis, and potentially pneumonia. It seems that every year he will contract an upper respiratory tract infection leading to a lower respiratory tract infection. He has recieved multiple courses of antibiotics, estimating that for the last 4-5 years, he has likely received at least 2 courses of Augmentin and 1 course of levofloxacin yearly. Each time that he lower respiratory tract infection the cough and sputum typically will resolve on its own after several weeks.     At the end of Thanksgiving, while visiting family in Utah, he again developed a runny nose, cough, congestion, and subjective fevers. Shortly thereafter, he began to have a cough productive of yellow sputum which he states has continued until today. In the beginning of January, he was evaluated and started on a course of Augmentin for 10 days. He says that he did not noticed a tremendous affect from this. A 2nd course of Augmentin at a potentially higher dose was given toward the end of January. He still continued to have cough, sputum, and intermittent diaphoresis and fevers. He was then started on levofloxacin for 10 days and  still had no improvement. Due to the concerns over his not improving, a CT of the chest was ordered, pulmonary function tests were ordered, and he was referred to the Stanford Chest Clinic. In addition, a 2nd course of levofloxacin has been ordered which he is currently taking. He believes he has approximately 4 days of this left. He has been having fevers, most recently to 101.2 F 10 days ago.    The patient describes his cough as copious and productive of yellow and green sputum at least for the last 6-8 weeks. He has not had any hemoptysis. He has experienced posttussive emesis (reports recent pertussis vaccination). Reports acid reflux but states it is relatively well controlled on Prilosec. To his knowledge, he does not have issues with dysphagia, odynophagia, or coughing after eating. The cough and sputum has limited his activity (no longer swimming) but was able to carry a 200 pound work bench with the help of a friend 1 week ago without significant limitations.     He denies any associated chest pain, presyncope. Currently, his sinus symptoms are relatively well controlled. He has no known history of prior tuberculosis, exposures to tuberculosis, history of valley fever, or other atypical infections. He does state that he has had a number of serial chest x-rays performed, and was told about a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe. He was also evaluated for a pneumonia once 8 years ago and potentially again 4 to 5 years ago. Finally, he denies any history of rash, swelling, or pain in joints or other rheumatologic issues.    Past Medical History:   1. Recurrent sinusitis complicated by lower respiratory tract infection  2.   Suspected recurrent bronchitis versus chronic bronchiectasis  3. History of nephrolithiasis.  4. Rhinoplasty in the 1970s for a broken nose.  5. Left suborbital blowout fracture in 1973 status post surgery.  6. Left shoulder replacement in 2004.  7. Left knee replacement 2008, right  knee replacements 2010 and 2012.  7. Total prostatectomy in 2010 for prostate cancer.  8. Rundell.  9. Hypertension.    Allergies:   1. Morphine causes the patient to have nausea and vomiting.  2. Prilosec has caused the patient to have diarrhea, unclear if this is related to Prilosec.    Home Medications:   1. Lipitor 20 mg daily.  2. Allopurinol 300 mg a day.  3. Multivitamin.  4. Atchison  500/50 one puff twice daily.  5. Mucinex 1200 mg t.i.d.  6. Levofloxacin 750 mg daily 4 days remaining.  7. Prilosec 1 tablet daily.  8. Benzonatate 100 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.  9. Levalbuterol nebulizer 1.25 mg between 2 and 3 times daily.  10. NyQuil use in the evening.  11. Robitussin p.r.n.    Social History:   The patient is a never smoker. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. He grew up in rural Indiana working on a farm and exposed to wheat dust, molds, and some pesticides. He is a veteran and served in Vietnam from 1971 to 1972 and was exposed to Agent Orange. Current hobbies include blacksmithing, which he does at a propane-fired forge. He has traveled to England and Mexico but denies any travel to the Roanoke . He has a dog at home. He has lived in Lexington  with his wife for the majority of his life. He has not had any other pets such as birds or rodents. The patient works in real estate. He is an avid swimmer and biker and has swum the Charleston  swim 6 times.    Family Medical History:   Notable for a father with emphysema.    Review Of Systems:   As per the HPI, a 14-point review of systems was otherwise negative.    Physical Examination:   Vital signs: Temperature 36.5, pulse 87, respirations 16, blood pressure is 122/75, O2 saturation is 95% on ambient air.   Weight is 200 pounds. Height is 6 feet, 1 inch.   In general, the patient is A and O by 3, very pleasant, coughing throughout the exam.   HEENT: Oropharynx is clear. Mallampati score is 2.   Eyes: Extraocular movements are intact. Pupils are equal, round, and  reactive to light. There may be a deformity around the left eye, but it is difficult to appreciate.   Nose: Nasal turbinates are somewhat red, but no mucopurulent discharge is noted. There are no polyps noted.   Ears: There is a tube placed in the left tympanic membrane. The tympanic membranes are otherwise clear bilaterally.   Neck: Supple. No palpable lymphadenopathy. JVP with the head of bed at 30 degrees is not elevated.   Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 are auscultated without appreciable murmur, rub, or gallop.   Respiratory: Respirations are unlabored. Excursion is symmetric. There are noted coarse rhonchi throughout the left lung fields with some diminished and bronchial breath sounds in the left base rhonchi. The rhonchi appear to become worse when the patient is lying flat. There are no wheezes appreciated.   Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds. Soft, nontender to palpation. No organomegaly is appreciated.   Extremities: No clubbing, no cyanosis. Capillary refill is brisk. There is no lower extremity edema.   Skin: No rashes or lesions are appreciated.   Neurological exam: Muscle strength: Head flexion and extension is 5/5. Grip strength is 5/5 bilaterally. There are no sensory deficits.    Laboratory Data:   CBC, 05/18/2015, demonstrates white blood cell count of 7.4, hemoglobin of 16.1, platelets 195, with 56% neutrophils.     CBC on 02/14/2016, demonstrates a white blood cell count of 13, hemoglobin 15.1, platelets of 235, with 79.6% neutrophils.     IgG serologies obtained on 02/14/2016, were normal including IgG, IgA and IgM.     C-ANCA, P-ANCA, ANA serologies as well as Aspergillus antibody and QuantiFERON were all negative on 02/14/2016. In addition, Mycoplasma pneumonia and Legionella serologies were negative at that time.    Imaging:   Reviewing the patient's chest x-rays dating back to 03/08/2013, there is the appearance of a right lower lobe  diaphragmatic irregularity as well as some airspace opacities in the right lower lobe. There is a left juxtacardiac opacity that seems to be present and intermittent since 2013.     CT of the chest on 02/18/2016, demonstrates diffuse bronchiectasis but considerably worse in the bilateral bases. There are scattered tree-in-bud opacities noted in the bilateral lobes. In the left base there is a large amount of consolidation with 1 particular area showing a lucency which is concerning either for a cavitary lesion or an air fluid level as in a necrotic process. The mediastinal lymph nodes are somewhat enlarged but not pathologically. There is similar bronchiectasis noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion.    Pulmonary Function Tests:   PFTs performed on 02/21/2016, demonstrated an FEV1/FVC ratio of 58 with a post bronchodilator FEV1 of 3.13 (97% of predicted). The post bronchodilator FVC is 5.43 (114% of predicted). Overall, spirometry is consistent with a mild obstructive ventilatory defect. There is no bronchodilator response on the study. The resting peak expiratory flows exceed that of the forced expiratory flows which is suggestive of negative effort dependence or dynamic airway collapse. The lung volumes are all supra-normal. The diffusion capacity is normal. The room air ABG is notable for an AA gradient of around 30, which is elevated.     Prior pulmonary function tests were performed on 05/18/2015, and demonstrated an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.70. The post bronchodilator FVC is 6.23 (122%), and the FEV1 is 4.36 (115% of predicted). This is consistent overall with normal spirometry. There are no DLCO or lung volumes available on this test.    Assessment:   1. Bilateral basal predominant but diffuse bronchiectasis.  2. Development of fixed obstructive ventilatory defect from 05/11/2015 to 02/11/2016.  3. Considerable left basal consolidation with a larger lesion showing an air  level concerning for necrotic pneumonia.  4. Multiple courses of Augmentin and levofloxacin on an outpatient basis.  5. History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  6. Initial workup for causes of chronic bronchiectasis negative.    Discussion:   Mr. Radigan unfortunately has a concerning consolidative process in his left lower lobe and to some degree in the right lung as well. Some of this has the suggestion of being either necrotic or potentially cavitary. There may be some communication to an airway, but this is not obvious. His history is suggestive of recurrent episodes of chronic bronchiectasis with potential intermittent pneumonia. This has likely led to his current picture of having chronic post-infectious bronchiectasis, and he now appears to be having a prolonged exacerbation with associated pneumonia.     The concern is that the pathogen leading to this is either an atypical organism (such as mycobacterium avium or similar) or is a drug-resistant organism given his multiple courses of prior antibiotics. Other causes for bronchiectasis include CVID, rheumatologic disorders, May syndrome, genetic defects (ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis), and Aspergillus. These seem to be less likely based off history and available lab data - we will complete the workup. There are cases of patients with some degree of cystic fibrosis trait presenting late in life with chronic bronchiectasis, but this is rare.    In order to expedite the diagnosis of the pathogen that Mr. Shertzer has, we have consented him for a bronchoscopy later today. We fear that he may need IV antibiotic therapy pending the results, but, given his clinical stability, we have recommended that he continue the course of Levaquin that he has been prescribed until we have more data back from the bronchoscopy. It is also possible the current antibiotic therapy will limit diagnostic yield.    He should institute aggressive airway clearance maneuvers,  particularly bronchodilator followed by 7% saline nebulizers followed by an Acapella device and a huff-cough maneuver at least every 4-6 hours a day. We suspect that this will be difficult for him initially, given the severity of his airway disease but, as airway clearance is achieved, hopefully, his symptoms will improve. Finally, given his (distant) exposure to the Midwest, we will send for atypical mycoses serologies such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis. We plan to speak with Mr. Soule in 48 to 72 hours after the results of his bronchoscopy result, and we plan to follow him serially in the Stanford Chest Clinic.    Recommendations:   1. Bronchoscopy with BAL today.  2. Serologies to evaluate for rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma/Sjogren syndrome, as well as serologies to evaluate for histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis.  3. Await results from bronchoscopy to tailor antibiotic therapy.  4. Aggressive airway clearance with bronchodilator 7% saline, Acapella device.   5. Short-term follow up in the Stanford Chest Clinic.  6. Patient will require repeat imaging of the chest 4 weeks after definitive therapy to re-evaluate the left lower lobe lesion.   7.   If bronchoscopic yield is limited by current antibiotic therapy, will arrange for serial induced sputum.      Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Mr. Shertzer. Please contact our clinic with any further questions.     The patient was seen by and discussed with Dr. Sletten.

His multiple orthopedic injuries include left shoulder replacement, right knee replacement and revision, and complications related to his left knee replacement.  He had his left knee replaced in 2008 after having an episode of spontaneous swelling. At that point, it was recommended that he undergo knee replacement due to degeneration of the joint. He reports that he recovered well from the surgery and had had no issues until recently. He reports that in March, he went to Dupont with grandchildren and walked about 5 or 6 miles for several days. Following this, on 03/28/2024, he was watching television and had a spontaneous episode of swelling of the left knee, which was drained and demonstrated bloody drainage. He subsequently had similar episodes happen on 04/08/2024, on 04/15/2024 about a week later, and then the last episode was 05/02/2024. In May, he was seen at the emergency department at Sequoia Hospital, at which point they felt it best not to drain the knee to reduce risk of infection.  He was referred to Dr. Zawacki for evaluation of recurrent left knee hemarthrosis with ultrasound demonstrating normal ABI's with normal flow throughout the popliteal artery, and a left knee fluid collection measuring 9x2x8cm.      Based on Dr. Bingham's assessment, it is unclear what precipitates the hemarthrosis, but differentials for possible causes include arterial venous malformation, pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal branch, synovial inflammation, and  unlikely but also potentially a tumor.  He is quite distressed by how the events have affected his life and would like to have answers as soon as possible. Dr. Esan believes it is sensible to proceed with a left lower extremity angiogram using provocative maneuvers to see if she can identify potential vascular causes of his bleeding episodes.  He is here today for left lower extremity angiogram, possible angioplasty and stent.

Apparently there is a family history of aneurysms. A paternal grandfather had what appears to have been an aneurysm, and his father had a symptomatic pararenal aneurysm that was fixed successfully, and he died of other causes.      Hon himself has never been a smoker and has no knowledge of any aneurysmal disease. He has undergone previous robotic prostatectomy without any documentation of any aneurysms at that time. He has also had episodes of recurrent pneumonia requiring prolonged treatment and followup CT scans with no recall of any thoracic aneurysms identified. There is also a family history of some cerebrovascular occlusive disease, and he has never had a carotid duplex study. He has no symptoms of TIA or amaurosis fugax. He does have a history of hyperlipidemia and he does take a statin.       His orthopedic surgery is well known to you. He has had right and left total knee arthroplasties, the right initially in 2006, the left in 2008. You revised his right total knee arthroplasty back in 2010, with a good result, and he was doing well until this April, when he developed what he describes as a somewhat spontaneous swelling in his left knee. He presented to his local physician, who performed an aspiration with drainage of 70 mL of what appeared to be hemorrhagic fluid. He felt better, and then 10 days later had recurrence of the swelling. Again 70 mL of a hemorrhagic appearing fluid was noted, and again did well for 6 days, when he had again another episode and yet 1 more aspiration of another 70 mL of fluid. He did well and then had recurrent swelling, but no additional aspirations.      He was seen by you in early May, at which point he was referred to our Vascular Clinic where my associate, Shayna Quartey, saw him. We discussed his case and recommended an arteriogram. Dr. Kane took him to the Cath Lab on 05/07/2024, where there was a hyperemic blush noted along the posterior capsule of the knee joint. She isolated this to a branch of one of the superior geniculates, and successfully coil embolized this segment and completion angiograms had greatly diminished the blushing identified, and there was only early refilling of the venous in a natural pattern. She was pleased with the procedure, as was the patient, but then he had additional leg swelling 5 days later, with no additional aspirations, and continues to have some swelling in the joint.      I understand he has seen you and discussed the option of a synovectomy, which I believe is appropriate. As you and I have noticed in the past, we have had some success with treatment of these geniculate branches with diminishing the blood supply to these hyperemic capsules, but in some situations it has been unsuccessful, as with Volkert. We discussed the  potential that this was some sort of a vasculogenic problem, which I do not believe it is. I reviewed Dr. Vermillion's notes, and there was no evidence for any significant bleeding from the other geniculate vessels. The genicular pattern appeared normal. She had multiple views of the popliteal artery that adequately identified all the branches of the potential bleeding sources. Furthermore, in reviewing the note from Stahl's sister, Sasso, I do not believe a CT angiogram would be helpful due to the scatter from the total knee joint.      We had a long discussion regarding his recurrent hemarthrosis, and I have recommended that Dublin proceed with your plan for synovectomy and replacement of his spacer, as these do wear down over time and may cause a micro-inflammatory response. As for his concerns for aneurysmal disease, I have scheduled him for an aortic duplex ultrasound, as well as a carotid duplex ultrasound, within the next several weeks, but I have told him I would not delay his knee surgery for the completion of these studies. I did review available imaging on his Stanford records, and his CT of the thorax in 09/11/2016 did not identify any thoracic aortic aneurysm, but did show some calcific change within the aortic wall.      All his questions were answered. I will set him up for his abdominal as well as carotid duplex studies, and we will meet again and discuss the results. Thanks again for allowing me to participate in his care.            Sincerely,       Holmquist, MD  Professor  Signed by Mehrotra, Lesley Peper, MD on 06/03/2017 at 0745      D: 06/02/2017 T: 06/02/2017 / MODL  SJN: [000000] DJN: [000000]     "

Unfortunately, his left  knee, done by Dr. Bart Sweetnam in 2008, continues to have recurrent hemarthrosis. He has had this aspirated 3 times. Each time, it is 70 to 80 mL of frank blood. He does not feel he is doing anything excessive, and these are spontaneous bleeds.      Today, he has a 2+ fluid swelling in his left knee, but it is not warm. His left knee ranges from 0 to 90 degrees and is mildly painful globally. No change in sciatic or femoral nerve function. His right knee extends fully, bends to 110 degrees, and is stable. Sciatic and femoral nerve, normal.      His radiographs show both knees in good position.     Impression: This patient has had recurrent hemarthrosis on the left. Although he has very mild flexion instability, I do not feel that this is gross enough to revise. I am going to ask Dr. Dino Wagstaff of Vascular Surgery to kindly weight in on this and investigate the recurrent hemarthroses further. I will see the patient thereafter.                 Bulow B Kleinberg, MD  Professor  Signed by Kleinberg, Verne Jett, MD on 04/24/2017 at 1339      CC:  Genao, MD      Crouse, MD     D: 04/23/2017 T: 04/24/2017 / MODL  SJN: [000000] DJN: 78968             "

Pt's behavior is normal. Judgment and thought content normal.    Imaging:  DEXA was ordered and obtained this morning, 10/23/2020.  T score:    -1.5 at the left femoral neck  -1.6 of the right femoral neck  -0.7 at the distal third radius    FINDINGS: The positioning for the scan was good.  Scan artifacts  were not observed.  There were moderate degenerative changes noted  in the lumbar spine, which may give higher than expected BMD  results.  L1 was eliminated from the BMD average of the spine  due to a known fracture.

Plan:  1. Osteopenia, as is evidenced by DEXA T score of -1.6 at the right femoral neck.  Recent injuries not considered fragility fracture since velocity and speed were contributors.  No history of fragility fractures.  Will obtain bone health labs to ensure no quality problems or depletion of mineralization. contributing factors for this patient's bone loss include history of kidney stones, Ammar with PPI use, history of prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy no ADT, and paternal family history of osteoporosis.    Pharmacologic Agents: Intervention with pharmacologic agents not indicated per bone density scan.  Patient has had an actual increase of bone density since 2010.  He states that he has retired since and has been more active.    Supplements: Vit D 2000IUs daily and Ca 600mg daily were recommended. I explained that these may be split into two doses in am and pm with food daily for best absorption.  Will adjust if indicated per lab results    Exercise: I explained to the patient that weightbearing exercises and resistance training is recommended to help to optimize bone re-formation and osteoblast activity.  Patient is extremely active.  I did discuss the difference between impact exercises and the Pikeville  versus swimming and the importance of increasing his impact exercise.  He states he will start  walking daily.    Falls prevention: We discussed falls prevention efforts and the importance of assistive devices as needed for balance and stability.  We discussed appropriate footwear and in-home safety measures.  Not considered a fall risk.    Follow-up: 1 to 2 weeks to discuss bone health labs and any interventions that may be needed.     Spent 45 minutes face-to-face with patient today discussing the disease management of osteoporosis for the reduction of future fractures. I have explained the bone strength is equal to bone equality and density so a DXA scan is important to complement care. Over half of the encounter time (50%) was spent counseling the patient on the disease osteoporosis, evidence based best practice treatment options available and recommendations for improved bone quality, importance of nutritional supplements for improved bone quality, falls prevention and personal safety for the reduction of future fractures. Clinician's guidelines to treatment for osteoporosis 2018 by the National Osteoporosis Foundation utilized are evidence based. Handouts were given to the patient for review on osteoporosis and other pharmacological treatment information related to other available treatment options for review.    Dictation by Dragon, variances may occur.    Getz Sokolowski, PA-C, MHA, CCD  Fracture Liaison Service  10/23/2020        "

Recall that I met him following his total knee arthroplasties, as he had an angiographic procedure to try and help with some recurrent hemarthrosis by my associate, Dr. Nyree Oliver. He was concerned over a family history of aneurysms and wanted to have an abdominal duplex done, which was done 1 year ago and was normal with no sign of any aneurysmal change in the iliacs or his aorta in the infrarenal position. We did also perform a carotid duplex at that time, and it just showed the plaque within the carotid bifurcation, but no velocity disturbances. He returns today for a followup with no new symptoms of amaurosis fugax or transient ischemia. He continues to work out vigorously 3 times per week and showed me some data from his workouts and his heart rate. He, in fact, rode his bike to his clinic appointment today. His carotid duplex today is unchanged from that of a year ago. Again, there was some mild plaque within the carotid bifurcation, but no evidence for  any hemodynamically significant stenosis. Based on his lifestyle, his limited plaque burden at this point in time, and his age, I do not believe additional followup is necessary. Should he have a new onset of TIA or amaurosis fugax symptoms, we went over today, he will contact us directly. Otherwise, we will see him back on a p.r.n. basis.             Thanks again for allowing us to participate in his care.

As you are well aware, he is a very pleasant 68-year-old gentleman who is relatively healthy, who has had bilateral knee replacements and revisions, who, unfortunately, has recently been suffering from recurrent hemarthrosis on the left side.      Mr. Taft reports that he had his left knee replaced back in 2008 after having an episode of spontaneous swelling. At that point, it was recommended that he undergo knee replacement due to degeneration of the joint. He reports that he recovered well from the surgery and had had no issues until recently. He reports that in March, he went to Chouinard with grandchildren and walked about 5 or 6 miles for several days. Following this, on 03/28/2024, he was watching television and had a spontaneous episode of swelling of the left knee, which was drained and demonstrated bloody drainage. He subsequently had similar episodes happen on 04/08/2024, on 04/15/2024 about a week later, and then  the last episode was 05/02/2024. In May, he was seen at the emergency department at Sequoia Hospital, at which point they felt it best not to drain the knee to reduce risk of infection.      He denied any known precipitating factors as he has significantly cut down on his exercise regimen to try to prevent any further bleeding.      Of note, he has had multiple previous orthopedic surgeries including left shoulder replacement, right knee replacement and revision, and eye surgeries, and he has also had a robotic surgery for prostate cancer surgery back in 2010. Around this time, he had testing done for coagulopathy due to issues with bleeding after his robotic prostate cancer surgery, which he reports were all normal.      His past medical history is relatively benign and includes high cholesterol, recurrent pneumonia with no recent episodes, and kidney stones. He currently takes allopurinol 300 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and a multivitamin daily.      His allergies include fentanyl and morphine.      His surgical history, as discussed above, includes left shoulder replacement, as well as bilateral knee replacements and revisions, as well as eye surgery. He also had robotic prostate cancer surgery in 2010 complicated by abdominal bleed requiring a reoperation and transfusion of at least 4-5 units of packed red blood cells.      Family history includes a father who died at age 85 with emphysema and CHF. His father also had an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was repaired. He also had a grandfather with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother died at age 91 after a 50-year history of multiple sclerosis.      On review of his social history, he is married for 47 years with 5 children and 12 grandchildren. He is a retired real estate developer and is a never smoker, does not drink alcohol, nor does he participate in recreational drug use.      His review of systems is otherwise negative, and he reports that he is otherwise  a very active person who bikes, swims, and goes to the gym 3 days a week prior to the episodes of hemarthrosis.      On exam, his temperature is 36.4, heart rate 70 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/79. He has palpable upper extremity pulses. His abdomen has well-healed incisions and is soft, nontender, nondistended. There are no pulsatile masses. He has palpable femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. He has multiple knee incisions bilaterally, and on the left side, there is no significant swelling or tenderness to palpation or range of motion.      Vascular ultrasound was done today that demonstrates normal flow through the popliteal artery on the left side with ABIs of 1.26 on the right and 1.13 on the left. There is evidence of a left knee fluid collection measuring 9 x 2 x 8 cm.      Overall, Mr. Taft is a relatively healthy 68-year-old gentleman with episodes of recurrent left knee hemarthroses after a knee replacement back in 2008. It is unclear what precipitated this episode, but differentials for possible causes include arterial venous malformation, pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal branch, synovial inflammation, and unlikely but also potentially a tumor. We do see fluid behind the knee, however, there are no other masses visible. He is quite distressed by how the events have affected his life and would like to have answers as soon as possible. We believe it is sensible to proceed with a left lower extremity angiogram using provocative maneuvers to see if we can identify potential vascular causes of his bleeding episodes. We will schedule this as soon as possible, potentially as soon as this Thursday, and we will be in touch with our findings.      Thank you very much for referring Mr. Taft to our Vascular Surgery Clinic, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions or concerns.     Delrosario, MD  Signed by Vidal, Stefon Pulido, MD on 05/06/2017  at 1845    Aman Loper, MD  Clinical Assistant Professor  Signed by Travis, Plumb, MD on 05/07/2017 at 0930          D: 05/05/2017 T: 05/05/2017 / MODL  SJN: [000000] DJN: [000000] R: 05/05/2017 cca QA/attnd  jw     "

He was seen by  Wallen last week for acute swelling in his knee without any trauma, or other incident that he suspects. The knee, that is the left non-revised one, was swollen, but not excessively warm. It was very painful. It was aspirated, and the ESR was 2, CRP less than 0.2, negative culture, negative alpha-defensin, red blood cells almost 3 million cell count, 1333 white blood cells. Neutrophils were 50%. It seems as though the patient had some sort of bleeding episode into the knee. He is not on any anticoagulants and did not bump his knee or injure it.      He did well for a few days, but then his knee became more painful and more swollen within the last few days. He has had no systemic symptoms otherwise.      He is active and works out at a gym.      Today, his hip is mobile, left side. His knee has a large effusion that is not warm. Range 0 to 110 degrees, no instability in flexion or extension, sciatic or femoral nerve no change.      His radiographs show no fractures and no other issues with regard to the knee replacement.      At this point, we do not think his knee is infected, but he may have torn a synovial piece. We will aspirate it again today at his request and cover the knee with a compressive bandage. We will have him back off from activities and get gentle physical therapy to decrease the swelling and increase his strength.     Venigalla B Zelaya, MD  Professor  Signed by Zelaya, Venigalla Tune, MD on 04/10/2017 at 1448     CC:    Pietz, MD     D: 04/09/2017 T: 04/10/2017 / MODL  SJN: [000000] DJN: 78782               "

He also has right 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th rib fractures. We recommended conservative treatment in a TLSO brace. He has been somewhat noncompliant with the TLSO brace, although he has not been doing very much due to the shelter in place. Overall, he is able to do all of his life activities. He has avoided lifting. He feels his back pain is getting better every day. He has been very conscious of his posture, as he has been working with this in Pilates in the past. He feels it is more of low back strain. He takes oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours and has a tapering schedule himself in terms of pain management, as he has had multiple other orthopedic surgeries and understands pain management. He denies any radicular symptoms.     Past Medical History: Prostate cancer, kidney stones.     Past Surgical History: Rhinoplasty, left shoulder replacement, right and left knee replacement twice each, suborbital blowout fracture, skull fracture.     Medications:   1.   Lipitor 40 mg.   2.   Oxycodone 5 mg q.4 hours.     Allergies: No known drug allergies.     Family History: Reviewed and noncontributory.     Social History: He denies tobacco smoking, alcohol use. Lives at home with his wife. He is retired.  Review Of Systems: Positive for symptoms as stated above in history of present illness; otherwise, remainder of review of systems is negative. No bowel or bladder dysfunction, no radicular symptoms.     Physical Examination: VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 118/67, temperature 98.3, height 6 feet 1 inch, 200 pounds, pulse 80, pain is 8/10. Overall, good coronal and sagittal balance. Normal gait. He has no significant tenderness midline to palpation and percussion, but more right side  T7-10th ribs on the right side. Straight leg test negative bilaterally. Hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, EHLs intact. Sensation intact to light touch in bilateral lower extremities.     Imaging: X-rays and CT scan done when he was in the emergency room visit demonstrate chronic midthoracic spine wedging with overall Scheuermann's kyphosis, and again more acute burst fracture at L1 and mild endplate fracture at T10. Overall, the alignment at T12 to L2 is good. Right T7-10 rib fractures.     Assessment: 71-year-old male who is 12 days status post a tree limb falling on his back, with an L1 burst fracture and a milder T10 superior endplate fracture with 4 rib fractures. Overall, doing relatively well with improvement in his back pain every day, treated conservatively. He has good overall coronal and sagittal balance.     Plan: He is reassured that these fractures will heal in 6 weeks. He should avoid flexion and hunching, and work on his posture so he can heal more in an acceptable alignment. He will also start to do some wall sits and overall avoid lifting 10 to 15 pounds. He should not be road bicycling and we do not recommend any physical therapy at this time. It is okay for him to do regular swimming, but no flip turns. He had multiple questions answered to his satisfaction. Again, taper down his pain medication and he is working with primary care doctor for this. I would like to see him back in about a month to get final x-rays and we only need a lateral scoliosis xray. He is comfortable with this plan.     Noah Glynn, PA-C    I, Lon Rittenbach, saw and examined the patient with the physician's assistant, performed a physical exam and obtained a history, review of systems, and formulated and discussed a plan with the patient during face to face interaction with the patient.  I agree with the note as documented above.    As above; healing well in good alignment after multiple  fractures.

The studies were completed today, and his abdominal study shows no true abdominal aortic or any iliac arterial aneurysms. He has no significant plaque as well. I reassured him of these findings. His carotid duplex study showed no evidence for any hemodynamically significant stenosis, but he does have some ectasia of the subclavian arteries bilaterally that is of no concern at this point in time.      I do recommend a followup study to see if there is any progression of these ectatic segments into true aneurysms, and I have told Marsh we will have him back in 6 months for a followup duplex ultrasound. There is no reason he should not proceed with his left knee surgery as planned. All his questions were answered.      Thanks again for allowing us to participate in his care.      Sincerely,            Cunningham, MD  Professor  Signed by Jemison, Thaddeus Cortes, MD on 06/09/2017 at 1526      D: 06/09/2017 T: 06/09/2017 / MODL  SJN: [000000] DJN: [000000]     "

As you are well aware, he is a very pleasant 68-year-old gentleman who is relatively healthy, who has had bilateral knee replacements and revisions, who, unfortunately, has recently been suffering from recurrent hemarthrosis on the left side.     Mr. Komm reports that he had his left knee replaced back in 2008 after having an episode of spontaneous swelling. At that point, it was recommended that he undergo knee replacement due to degeneration of the joint. He reports that he recovered well from the surgery and had had no issues until recently. He reports that in March, he went to Wilkinson with grandchildren and walked about 5 or 6 miles for several days. Following this, on 03/28/2024, he was watching television and had a spontaneous episode of swelling of the left knee, which was drained and demonstrated bloody drainage. He subsequently had similar episodes happen on 04/08/2024, on 04/15/2024 about a week later, and then the  last episode was 05/02/2024. In May, he was seen at the emergency department at Sequoia Hospital, at which point they felt it best not to drain the knee to reduce risk of infection.     He denied any known precipitating factors as he has significantly cut down on his exercise regimen to try to prevent any further bleeding.     Of note, he has had multiple previous orthopedic surgeries including left shoulder replacement, right knee replacement and revision, and eye surgeries, and he has also had a robotic surgery for prostate cancer surgery back in 2010. Around this time, he had testing done for coagulopathy due to issues with bleeding after his robotic prostate cancer surgery, which he reports were all normal.     His past medical history is relatively benign and includes high cholesterol, recurrent pneumonia with no recent episodes, and kidney stones. He currently takes allopurinol 300 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and a multivitamin daily.     His allergies include fentanyl and morphine.     His surgical history, as discussed above, includes left shoulder replacement, as well as bilateral knee replacements and revisions, as well as eye surgery. He also had robotic prostate cancer surgery in 2010 complicated by abdominal bleed requiring a reoperation and transfusion of at least 4-5 units of packed red blood cells.     Family history includes a father who died at age 85 with emphysema and CHF. His father also had an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was repaired. He also had a grandfather with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother died at age 91 after a 50-year history of multiple sclerosis.     On review of his social history, he is married for 47 years with 5 children and 12 grandchildren. He is a retired real estate developer and is a never smoker, does not drink alcohol, nor does he participate in recreational drug use.     His review of systems is otherwise negative, and he reports that he is otherwise a very  active person who bikes, swims, and goes to the gym 3 days a week prior to the episodes of hemarthrosis.     On exam, his temperature is 36.4, heart rate 70 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/79. He has palpable upper extremity pulses. His abdomen has well-healed incisions and is soft, nontender, nondistended. There are no pulsatile masses. He has palpable femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. He has multiple knee incisions bilaterally, and on the left side, there is no significant swelling or tenderness to palpation or range of motion.     Vascular ultrasound was done today that demonstrates normal flow through the popliteal artery on the left side with ABIs of 1.26 on the right and 1.13 on the left. There is evidence of a left knee fluid collection measuring 9 x 2 x 8 cm.     Overall, Mr. Nevarez is a relatively healthy 68-year-old gentleman with episodes of recurrent left knee hemarthroses after a knee replacement back in 2008. It is unclear what precipitated this episode, but differentials for possible causes include arterial venous malformation, pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal branch, synovial inflammation, and unlikely but also potentially a tumor. We do see fluid behind the knee, however, there are no other masses visible. He is quite distressed by how the events have affected his life and would like to have answers as soon as possible. We believe it is sensible to proceed with a left lower extremity angiogram using provocative maneuvers to see if we can identify potential vascular causes of his bleeding episodes. We will schedule this as soon as possible, potentially as soon as this Thursday, and we will be in touch with our findings.     Thank you very much for referring Mr. Komm to our Vascular Surgery Clinic, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions or concerns.

As you are well aware, he is a 67-year-old gentleman with a history of nonallergic rhinosinusitis status post sinus surgeries, history of nephrolithiasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a history of prostate cancer status post radical prostatectomy, who is now being seen in the Stanford Chest Clinic for abnormal CT findings concerning for a necrotizing pneumonia. He has been referred to us as an outpatient for this issue.     Mr. Kimmel states that through the majority of his later life he has had issues with recurrent sinusitis, cough, bronchitis, and potentially pneumonia. It seems that every year he will contract an upper respiratory tract infection leading to a lower respiratory tract infection. He has recieved multiple courses of antibiotics, estimating that for the last 4-5 years, he has likely received at least 2 courses of Augmentin and 1 course of levofloxacin yearly. Each time that he lower respiratory tract infection the cough and sputum typically will resolve on its own  after several weeks.     At the end of Thanksgiving, while visiting family in Utah, he again developed a runny nose, cough, congestion, and subjective fevers. Shortly thereafter, he began to have a cough productive of yellow sputum which he states has continued until today. In the beginning of January, he was evaluated and started on a course of Augmentin for 10 days. He says that he did not noticed a tremendous affect from this. A 2nd course of Augmentin at a potentially higher dose was given toward the end of January. He still continued to have cough, sputum, and intermittent diaphoresis and fevers. He was then started on levofloxacin for 10 days and still had no improvement. Due to the concerns over his not improving, a CT of the chest was ordered, pulmonary function tests were ordered, and he was referred to the Stanford Chest Clinic. In addition, a 2nd course of levofloxacin has been ordered which he is currently taking. He believes he has approximately 4 days of this left. He has been having fevers, most recently to 101.2 F 10 days ago.    The patient describes his cough as copious and productive of yellow and green sputum at least for the last 6-8 weeks. He has not had any hemoptysis. He has experienced posttussive emesis (reports recent pertussis vaccination). Reports acid reflux but states it is relatively well controlled on Prilosec. To his knowledge, he does not have issues with dysphagia, odynophagia, or coughing after eating. The cough and sputum has limited his activity (no longer swimming) but was able to carry a 200 pound work bench with the help of a friend 1 week ago without significant limitations.     He denies any associated chest pain, presyncope. Currently, his sinus symptoms are relatively well controlled. He has no known history of prior tuberculosis, exposures to tuberculosis, history of valley fever, or other atypical infections. He does state that he has had a number of serial chest  x-rays performed, and was told about a persistent opacity in the left lower lobe. He was also evaluated for a pneumonia once 8 years ago and potentially again 4 to 5 years ago. Finally, he denies any history of rash, swelling, or pain in joints or other rheumatologic issues.    Past Medical History:   1. Recurrent sinusitis complicated by lower respiratory tract infection  2. Suspected recurrent bronchitis versus chronic bronchiectasis  3. History of nephrolithiasis.  4. Rhinoplasty in the 1970s for a broken nose.  5. Left suborbital blowout fracture in 1973 status post surgery.  6. Left shoulder replacement in 2004.  7. Left knee replacement 2008, right knee replacements 2010 and 2012.  7. Total prostatectomy in 2010 for prostate cancer.  8. Light.  9. Hypertension.      Allergies:   1. Morphine causes the patient to have nausea and vomiting.  2. Prilosec has caused the patient to have diarrhea, unclear if this is related to Prilosec.    Home Medications:    1. Lipitor 20 mg daily.  2. Allopurinol 300 mg a day.  3. Multivitamin.  4. Wolfforth  500/50 one puff twice daily.  5. Mucinex 1200 mg t.i.d.  6. Levofloxacin 750 mg daily 4 days remaining.  7. Prilosec 1 tablet daily.  8. Benzonatate 100 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.  9. Levalbuterol nebulizer 1.25 mg between 2 and 3 times daily.  10. NyQuil use in the evening.  11. Robitussin p.r.n.    Social History:    The patient is a never smoker. He denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. He grew up in rural Indiana working on a farm and exposed to wheat dust, molds, and some pesticides. He is a veteran and served in Vietnam from 1971 to 1972 and was exposed to Agent Orange. Current hobbies include blacksmithing, which he does at a propane-fired forge. He has traveled to England and Mexico but denies any travel to the Pawleys Island . He has a dog at home. He has lived in Delta  with his wife for the majority of his life. He has not had any other pets such as birds or rodents. The  patient works in real estate. He is an avid swimmer and biker and has swum the Bristow  swim 6 times.    Family Medical History:    Notable for a father with emphysema.    Review Of Systems:    As per the HPI, a 14-point review of systems was otherwise negative.    Physical Examination:    Vital signs: Temperature 36.5, pulse 87, respirations 16, blood pressure is 122/75, O2 saturation is 95% on ambient air.    Weight is 200 pounds. Height is 6 feet, 1 inch.    In general, the patient is A and O by 3, very pleasant, coughing throughout the exam.    HEENT: Oropharynx is clear. Mallampati score is 2.    Eyes: Extraocular movements are intact. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. There may be a deformity around the left eye, but it is difficult to appreciate.    Nose: Nasal turbinates are somewhat red, but no mucopurulent discharge is noted. There are no polyps noted.    Ears: There is a tube placed in the left tympanic membrane. The tympanic membranes are otherwise clear bilaterally.    Neck: Supple. No palpable lymphadenopathy. JVP with the head of bed at 30 degrees is not elevated.    Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 are auscultated without appreciable murmur, rub, or gallop.    Respiratory: Respirations are unlabored. Excursion is symmetric. There are noted coarse rhonchi throughout the left lung fields with some diminished and bronchial breath sounds in the left base rhonchi. The rhonchi appear to become worse when the patient is lying flat. There are no wheezes appreciated.    Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds. Soft, nontender to palpation. No organomegaly is appreciated.    Extremities: No clubbing, no cyanosis. Capillary refill is brisk. There is no lower extremity edema.    Skin: No rashes or lesions are appreciated.    Neurological exam: Muscle strength: Head flexion and extension is 5/5. Grip strength is 5/5 bilaterally. There are no sensory deficits.    Laboratory Data:    CBC,  05/18/2015, demonstrates white blood cell count of 7.4, hemoglobin of 16.1, platelets 195, with 56% neutrophils.   CBC on 02/14/2016, demonstrates a white blood cell count of 13, hemoglobin 15.1, platelets of 235, with 79.6% neutrophils.   IgG serologies obtained on 02/14/2016, were normal including IgG, IgA and IgM.   C-ANCA, P-ANCA, ANA serologies as well as Aspergillus antibody and QuantiFERON were all negative on 02/14/2016. In addition, Mycoplasma pneumonia and Legionella serologies were negative at that time.    Imaging:    Reviewing the patient's chest x-rays dating back to 03/08/2013, there is the appearance of a right lower lobe diaphragmatic irregularity as well as some airspace opacities in the right lower lobe. There is a left juxtacardiac opacity that seems to be present and intermittent since 2013.   CT of the chest on 02/18/2016, demonstrates diffuse bronchiectasis but considerably worse in the bilateral bases. There are scattered tree-in-bud opacities noted in the bilateral lobes. In the left base there is a large amount of consolidation with 1 particular area showing a lucency which is concerning either for a cavitary lesion or an air fluid level as in a necrotic process. The mediastinal lymph nodes are somewhat enlarged but not pathologically. There is similar bronchiectasis noted in the right lower lobe. No pericardial effusion.    Pulmonary Function Tests:    PFTs performed on 02/21/2016, demonstrated an FEV1/FVC ratio of 58 with a post bronchodilator FEV1 of 3.13 (97% of predicted). The post bronchodilator FVC is 5.43 (114% of predicted). Overall, spirometry is consistent with a mild obstructive ventilatory defect. There is no bronchodilator response on the study. The resting peak expiratory flows exceed that of the forced expiratory flows which is suggestive of negative effort dependence or dynamic airway collapse. The lung volumes are all supra-normal.  The diffusion capacity is normal. The room air ABG is notable for an AA gradient of around 30, which is elevated.     Prior pulmonary function tests were performed on 05/18/2015, and demonstrated an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.70. The post bronchodilator FVC is 6.23 (122%), and the FEV1 is 4.36 (115% of predicted). This is consistent overall with normal spirometry. There are no DLCO or lung volumes available on this test.    Assessment:   1. Bilateral basal predominant but diffuse bronchiectasis.  2. Development of fixed obstructive ventilatory defect from 05/11/2015 to 02/11/2016.  3. Considerable left basal consolidation with a larger lesion showing an air level concerning for necrotic pneumonia.  4. Multiple courses of Augmentin and levofloxacin on an outpatient basis.  5. History of gastroesophageal reflux disease.  6. Initial workup for causes of chronic bronchiectasis negative.    Discussion:    Mr. Ginsberg unfortunately has a concerning consolidative process in his left lower lobe and to some degree in the right lung as well. Some of this has the suggestion of being either necrotic or potentially cavitary. There may be some communication to an airway, but this is not obvious. His history is suggestive of recurrent episodes of chronic bronchiectasis with potential intermittent pneumonia. This has likely led to his current picture of having chronic post-infectious bronchiectasis, and he now appears to be having a prolonged exacerbation with associated pneumonia.     The concern is that the pathogen leading to this is either an atypical organism (such as mycobacterium avium or similar) or is a drug-resistant organism given his multiple courses of prior antibiotics. Other causes for bronchiectasis include CVID, rheumatologic disorders, Mikesell syndrome, genetic defects (ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis), and Aspergillus. These seem to be less likely based off history and available lab data - we will complete  the workup. There are cases of patients with some degree of cystic fibrosis trait presenting late in life with chronic bronchiectasis, but this is rare.    In order to expedite the diagnosis of the pathogen that Mr. Lupinetti has, we have consented him for a bronchoscopy later today. We fear that he may need IV antibiotic therapy pending the results, but, given his clinical stability, we have recommended that he continue the course of Levaquin that he has been prescribed until we have more data back from the bronchoscopy. It is also possible the current antibiotic therapy will limit diagnostic yield.    He should institute aggressive airway clearance maneuvers, particularly bronchodilator followed by 7% saline nebulizers followed by an Acapella device and a huff-cough maneuver at least every 4-6 hours a day. We suspect that this will be difficult for him initially, given the severity of his airway disease but, as airway clearance is achieved, hopefully, his symptoms will improve. Finally, given his (distant) exposure to the Midwest, we will send for atypical mycoses serologies such as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis. We plan to speak with Mr. Tanksley in 48 to 72 hours after the results of his bronchoscopy result, and we plan to follow him serially in the Stanford Chest Clinic.    Recommendations:   1. Bronchoscopy with BAL today.  2. Serologies to evaluate for rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma/Sjogren syndrome, as well as serologies to evaluate for histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, and blastomycosis.  3. Await results from bronchoscopy to tailor antibiotic therapy.  4. Aggressive airway clearance with bronchodilator 7% saline, Acapella device.    5. Short-term follow up in the Stanford Chest Clinic.  6. Patient will require repeat imaging of the chest 4 weeks after definitive therapy to re-evaluate the left lower lobe lesion.    7. If bronchoscopic yield is limited by current antibiotic therapy,  will arrange for serial induced sputum.            Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of Mr. Kisner.

DIAGNOSIS: Left hip arthritis   SURGEON: Dr. Adrien Pascua    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Today, I had the pleasure of seeing Zoe G Malik, who is a 75 Y male returning patient of Dr. Zimmet presenting with left hip pain. Patient with a known past medical history that includes; hx of bilateral Total Knee Arthoplasties revision (right 2010, left 2017). States that symptoms began over the last year or so with catching of the left hip, worst with weight bearing activities and going downstairs. Pain is localized to the left deep groin area. They have tried a number of different interventions to try and manage symptoms these include; pain medication and strict home exercise regimen without any significant relief. He was seen by his Physiatrist who ordered an MRI and recommended patient to see and Ortho surgeon to discuss Total Hip Arthroplasty. Patient is currently ambulating with no assistance.

He reports adequate pain control on the current pain regimen. He expresses a desire to receive less medication thorugh his nerve block as the numbness is making him anxious. He would like to take the nerve block home, and plans to be discharged today.    The nerve catheter is functioning well at current infusion.     Accordingly, the pain management plan is:  1. DECREASE infusion to  Ropivacaine 0.2% 2ml q 60min AB + 2ml q30min DB  2. Add gabapentin 100mg tid  3.

The importance of catheter site care, follow-up questions, catheter removal, and the potential risk/problems including leaking, and infection of the site have been discussed in detailed. Patient/wife indicates understanding. Education Pamphlet including contact number for Regional Anesthesia provided. All questions answered.

Found to have mildly/moderately displace rib fractures R 7-10 with trace R effusion/hemothorax, acute T10-L1 endplate fracture.    Brief Clinical Context:    Mr. Tomlinson is a very robust 71M who played college basketball at Stanford and has had several b/l knee replacements and a L shoulder replacement in his youth. He served in Vietnam as a convoy manager. He then graduated from Stanford business school and enjoyed a long career in real estate, retiring at age 68. He lives in Madison  with his wife of 50 years and has 5 children and 12 grandchildren. He is socially active in the Church of Latter Day Saints. He is very physically active, exercising 6 days per week, going to Orange Theory 3x/weekly and swimming 2k yards 3x weekly with occasional bike rides w/o cardiorespiratory or syncopal symptoms. He has a h/o bronchiectasis with some obstruction on PFTs, though does not require any daily inhalers or medications. He takes allopurinol for kidney stone ppx and atorvastatin, as well as vitamins and occasional melatonin for sleep. He denies h/o EtOH, tobacco, drugs. He manages all iADLs and ADLs on his own. He denies memory issues or depression.    On 05/17/2020, he was helping clear out trees in the York  mountains. When chopping down an 80-foot tree with a chainsaw, the tree fell and hit a neighboring tree branch, which  fell and landed on Mr. Vaswani, knocking him to the ground. He felt significant rib and back pain, though no neurologic symptoms, never lost consciousness, and was brought to the ED, where he was found to have mildly/moderately displace rib fractures R 7-10 with trace R effusion/hemothorax, acute T10-L1 endplate fracture.

COMPARISON EXAMINATION:  None. CLINICAL HISTORY:  50-year-old male with left flank pain. TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast images were obtained from the level of T12 through the symphysis pubis and computer-generated images were then obtained. FINDINGS:  The incidentally imaged lung bases demonstrate a small area of atelectasis or scarring at the left base.  No pleural effusions are present. The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and adrenal glands are normal on this noncontrast study. The kidneys contain multiple, small, punctate calcifications bilaterally, which appear to be within the collecting system.  The largest stone is seen in the right inferior pole and measures approximately 3-4 mm in size.  Minimal left-sided perinephric stranding is present and the left collecting system appears slightly prominent compared with the right.  A small calcification measuring approximately 3 mm in size is seen at the left uterovesical junction. No other calcifications are seen along the course of either ureter. There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis. There is no free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.  The bowel is nondilated and without focal bowel wall thickening.  There is a small nodule seen anterior to the superior pole of the spleen, measuring approximately 1 cm in size, best seen on image 6, which likely represents a splenule.  The bones are unremarkable with no destructive lesions present. IMPRESSION: BILATERAL NEPHROLITHIASIS WITH A LEFT-SIDED UVJ STONE MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 3 MM IN SIZE.

PTT may be prolonged by factor deficiency, drug effect (heparin, LMWH, fondaparinux, argatroban, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)). Evaluation of prolonged PTT: Exclude drug effect. A PTT inhibitor screen can be ordered to distinguish between factor deficiency and factor inhibitor. Unfractionated heparin monitoring: Traditionally, a PTT of 1.5-2.5 times control value has been used for heparin monitoring. However, patients with prolonged baseline PTT (e.g. as seen with lupus anticoagulants, liver disease or drug effect) cannot be reliably monitored by this method. Thus, for heparin monitoring, heparin activity level (HAL) in anti-Xa U/mL is used for most heparin nomograms in Epic at SHC. The therapeutic range for heparin therapy of venous thromboembolic disease is 0.3 - 0.7 anti-Xa U/mL (the recommended range can vary with the indication for heparin therapy - see heparin protocols for suggested ranges). Other anticoagulant drugs, such as LMWH, fondaparinux and anti-Xa targeted DOACs can interfere with heparin activity assessment by anti-Xa activity if given concomitantly. For reference, the unfractionated heparin therapeutic range from 0.3-0.7 anti-Xa U/mL corresponds to a PTT result of 64-106 sec in the Stanford Coagulation Laboratory using STA-R Max/Evolution automated instrument and Hemosil aPTT SynthAsil reagent. This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by Stanford Coagulation Laboratory. It has not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. The FDA does not require this test to go through premarket FDA review. This test is used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing."

COMPARISON: CT chest 02/18/2016. PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the chest was performed without IV  contrast.  Dose information: Based on a 32 cm phantom, the estimated radiation  dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is 0.11. The  estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 4.66. FINDINGS: Medical devices: None. Thyroid: There is an unchanged 4 mm hypodense lesion in the right  thyroid lobe which is too small to characterize. Lymph nodes: Limited evaluation without IV contrast. A few prominent  mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes are seen which are not  enlarged by CT size criteria. No supraclavicular, axillary,  mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. Vasculature: Limited evaluation without IV contrast. Aorta and main  pulmonary artery diameters are within normal range. Scattered  atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the thoracic aorta. Heart: Mild coronary artery calcification. No pericardial effusion. Other mediastinal structures: Normal noncontrast appearance. Lung parenchyma: Interval decrease in mixed consolidative and  groundglass opacities in the bilateral lower lobes (series 604, image  210).  Persistent right middle lobe centrilobular nodularity is seen  which is decreased compared to the prior study (series 604, image  193). Significantly improved small clustered centrilobular nodules  are also seen in the posterior lateral right upper lobe (series 604,  image 146).    There has been interval resolution of the  consolidation with focal air lucency in the left lower lobe. There is  a 2 mm solid pulmonary nodule in the right upper lobe (series 303,  image 90) and a 4 mm solid pulmonary nodule in the peripheral right  lower lobe (series 3 of 3, image 185). There is also a 2 mm partially  calcified pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe (series 303, image  132). A 4 mm peripheral solid pulmonary nodule is also seen in the  left lower lobe (series 303, image 128) as well as a 3 mm solid  pulmonary nodule adjacent to the pleura in the left lower lobe  (series 3 of 3, image 197).. Airways: There is persistent bilateral bronchial wall thickening in  the lower lobes with interval improvement of mucus plugging and  impaction.. Pleura: Normal. Chest wall and spine: Multilevel degenerative changes of the  thoracolumbar spine are seen. No aggressive bone lesions.  Postsurgical changes of left shoulder arthroplasty are seen. Upper abdomen: Normal noncontrast appearance. : 1.  Interval improvement in bibasilar tree-in-bud nodular opacities  with improved airways thickening and mucus impaction likely  representing improving bronchocentric spread of  infection/inflammation. 2.  Interval improvement in the cluster of bronchocentric nodules in  the right upper lobe inferiorly and laterally which likely represents  improving infection. 3.  Redemonstrated prominent mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes  which may be reactive. 4.  A few bilateral solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm,  which may be infectious in etiology. Recommend follow-up CT chest in  one year to assess for resolution and/or stability.

He served in Vietnam as a  convoy manager. He then graduated from Stanford business school  and enjoyed a long career in real estate, retiring at age 68. He  lives in Elkhart  with his wife of 50 years and has 5 children  and 12 grandchildren. He is socially active in the Church of  Latter Day Saints. He is very physically active, exercising 6  days per week, going to Orange Theory 3x/weekly and swimming 2k  yards 3x weekly with occasional bike rides w/o cardiorespiratory  or syncopal symptoms. He has a h/o bronchiectasis with some  obstruction on PFTs, though does not require any daily inhalers  or medications. He takes allopurinol for kidney stone ppx and  atorvastatin, as well as vitamins and occasional melatonin for  sleep. He denies h/o EtOH, tobacco, drugs. He manages all iADLs  and ADLs on his own. He denies memory issues or depression. On 05/17/2020, he was helping clear out trees in the Haiku   mountains. When chopping down an 80-foot tree with a chainsaw,  the tree fell and hit a neighboring tree branch, which fell and  landed on Mr. Ruckman, knocking him to the ground. He felt  significant rib and back pain, though no neurologic symptoms,  never lost consciousness, and was brought to the ED, where he was  found to have mildly/moderately displace rib fractures R 7-10  with trace R effusion/hemothorax, acute T10-L1 endplate fracture.  He has been treated medically and doing well with pain control.

Thus elevated D-dimer is not specific for DVT/PE. However, ELISA-based D-dimer detection is very sensitive and associated with a high negative predictive value. In studies where the pre-test probability of DVT/PE was low, the negative predictive value approaches 100%. However with a high pre-test probability of DVT/PE, the negative predictive value falls to 80-85%. Thus a patient with a low pre-test likelihood of DVT/PE and a negative D-dimer ELISA (<500 ng/ml FEU) is very unlikely to have DVT or PE. The test is therefore useful in excluding the disease and limiting the clinical evaluation, particularly in the outpatient setting, where the disease prevalence is low."

TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast images were obtained from the level of T12 through the symphysis pubis and computer-generated images were then obtained. FINDINGS:  The incidentally imaged lung bases demonstrate a small area of atelectasis or scarring at the left base.  No pleural effusions are present. The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and adrenal glands are normal on this noncontrast study. The kidneys contain multiple, small, punctate calcifications bilaterally, which appear to be within the collecting system.  The largest stone is seen in the right inferior pole and measures approximately 3-4 mm in size.  Minimal left-sided perinephric stranding is present and the left collecting system appears slightly prominent compared with the right.  A small calcification measuring approximately 3 mm in size is seen at the left uterovesical junction. No other calcifications are seen along the course of either ureter. There are no abnormally enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen or pelvis. There is no free fluid in the abdomen or pelvis.  The bowel is nondilated and without focal bowel wall thickening.  There is a small nodule seen anterior to the superior pole of the spleen, measuring approximately 1 cm in size, best seen on image 6, which likely represents a splenule.  The bones are unremarkable with no destructive lesions present. IMPRESSION: BILATERAL NEPHROLITHIASIS WITH A LEFT-SIDED UVJ STONE MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 3 MM IN SIZE. END OF IMPRESSION: SUMMARY: Possible Significant Abnormality/Change, may need action. I have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agree with the report transcribed above.

Should be obtained in 09/11/2017. COMPARISON: Studies dating back to 02/18/2016. PROCEDURE COMMENTS: CT of the chest was performed without IV contrast.  Dose information: Based on a 32 cm phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam is 11.27. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is 447.54. FINDINGS: Medical devices: None. Thyroid: Normal. Lymph nodes: Limited evaluation without IV contrast. No supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. Vasculature: Limited evaluation without IV contrast. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated measuring 4.1 cm, unchanged. Mild atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta and its major branches. Heart: Minimal coronary artery calcification. No pericardial effusion. Other mediastinal structures: Normal noncontrast appearance. Lung parenchyma: There is persistent groundglass and reticulation in the right middle and lower lobes that is unchanged from 08/28/2016 that likely represents postinfectious/inflammatory scarring. Linear bands of scarring are also noted in the left lower lobe. There are numerous pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in the left lower lobe that are unchanged from 02/18/2016 (e.g., 303/166, 176). Several subcentimeter subpleural nodules versus areas of focal atelectasis in the left lower lobe are unchanged. Airways: Mild cylindrical bronchiectasis in the lower lobes. Pleura: Normal. Chest wall and spine: Moderate degenerative changes in the spine. Partially visualized severe degenerative changes in the right shoulder and left total shoulder arthroplasty. Chronic anterior wedging of T8-T10. Upper abdomen: Left renal cortical scarring. IMPRESSION: 1.  Persistent groundglass and reticulation in the right middle and lower lobes that is unchanged from 08/28/2016 and likely represents postinfectious/inflammatory scarring. 2.

The AP Spine, Femur, Forearm and Total Body analyses use the USA (Combined NHANES/Lunar) reference database.  Bone Density images are available for viewing on the Stanford Healthcare Centricity PACS System. FINDINGS: The positioning for the scan was good.  Scan artifacts were not observed.  There were moderate degenerative changes noted in the lumbar spine, which may give higher than expected BMD results.  L1 was eliminated from the BMD average of the spine due to a known fracture.

In untreated patients, the risk of osteoporotic fracture increases approximately two-fold for each 1.0 SD decrease in T-score.  Low bone density is not the only risk factor for fracture; also consider factors such as the patient's age, frailty or poor health, risk of falling, risk of injury, previous osteoporotic fracture, family history of osteoporosis, cigarette smoking, low body weight, etc.. Not everyone with a low trauma fracture has osteoporosis; osteomalacia and other metabolic bone disorders should also be considered.  Patients who have osteoporosis should be evaluated for specific diseases and conditions (secondary causes) that may cause or contribute to bone loss and fracture risk. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends pharmacological intervention for patients with a prior hip or vertebral fracture regardless of BMD T-score.  The patient should follow a healthful lifestyle (good nutrition with adequate calcium and vitamin D, and appropriate weight- bearing exercise). Follow-up: Consider repeating this study on 2 to 3 years to reassess this patient's status, or sooner if there is some new clinical indication.  Impression: The patient has low bone mass, based on the lowest T-score. The patient has risk factors, including: parental hip fracture. All results must be clinically correlated prior to initiating treatment.  Bone density measurements at only one skeletal site may not provide a complete assessment of bone health.  When multiple sites are scanned and if impression is based on forearm, additional testing may be performed to rule out secondary causes, i.e. Hyperparathyroidism.

Cluster of bronchocentric nodules in the right upper lobe  inferiorly and laterally with focal groundglass component measuring  10 mm, likely infectious. Attention on follow-up. 3.  Scattered solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 8 mm in the  subpleural left lower lobe. Comparison to priors would be helpful to  evaluate for stability.

As you know, he is the president and owner of a real estate company, and is 62 years of age and in excellent health. He had a right total knee replacement for degenerative arthritis on 08/26/2005. The Stryker Scorpio posterior stabilized knee was used. Unfortunately, he had a posterior dislocation and needed a  revision surgery, which of the tibial spacer. He continues to have problems with the knee and it appears as though the tibial component is loose and the spacer has been extruded. He had some blood work on 08/21/2010, which showed a normal white blood count, a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit. His PT, PTT, and INR were all normal as well. He had a bone density of his right and left hip, which showed some osteopenia, but his spine bone density was normal. There is a family history of osteoporosis.    Because of the above, he has pain in his right knee, all over his knee. He has difficulty walking and exercising and icing is a big part of his knee treatment.     He can walk about 5-10 blocks and has some mild pain. He continues to work out and be as active as he can, and uses no aids. He works out 5 days a week.       He works about 50% of the time. He is married with 5 children. He is a nonsmoker and a nondrinker.     He has had a contralateral left total knee replacement in 07/11/2008, and a shoulder replacement on 05/11/2004.     He has had his prostate removed in 07/11/2008 and had hemorrhage postoperatively. He had a scleral buckle in 2004 in his left eye, and a fractured cheek/skull in 1974. He has had multiple admissions for kidney stones.     His mother had multiple sclerosis. His father had an aortic abdominal aneurysm.     Review of systems shows that the patient ""tends to bleed post surgery."" He has had kidney stones and prostate cancer with removal. He has had shoulder surgery on the left.     He has allergies to morphine. He has had trouble with pain medications as well. He says he is allergic to morphine and Fentanyl.     He is on allopurinol, Lipitor, and a multivitamin.     He is an extremely healthy male. Clinically, he seems very fit and is about 62 inches tall, 197 pounds. His hips are mobile bilaterally and his left knee has a satisfactory range and stability. The left knee straightens virtually  completely and flexes to about 115 degrees. Flexion extension gaps are well balanced.     The left knee is definitely posteriorly subluxated. It is a bit swollen and it is unstable in flexion and extension. I can straighten it virtually completely, and bend it to about 120 degrees, but there is posterior subluxation that is quite noticeable. His foot pulses are palpable. The neurological is normal in the right lower extremity.     His radiographs are quite interesting. These show a tricompartmental Scorpio Stryker total knee replacement. The knee is aligned in slight varus. There is definite loosening of the tibial component with the anterior aspect sinking into the metaphysis and lifting up of the posterior portion of the base plate, such that the stem is touching the posterior cortex. The tibial insert has fractured, or at least slipped out of the alignment housing of the base plate. It is also extruded laterally somewhat. The patella is rather thin; that is his host bone.   I have gone over the above with the patient and his wife. It is clear that this patient is in need of revision rather expeditiously. I have told him about this in detail and taken some blood work to rule out a low grade infection. I have told him about revision of both components, that is tibial and femoral, and we will examine the patella as well. I have talked to him about the pro's, con's, possible complications, blood requirements, and other matters related to the surgery. Questions were asked and answered. We will have him followed by a hospitalist while in hospital here and we will try and get him on the schedule in due course.     Thank you very much for asking me to see this interesting patient.

As you know, this is a very pleasant, 62-year-old, right-handed, real estate executive who had a left total shoulder replacement in 2005. He recently had a knee placing revision performed by Dr. Fraga's office and was somewhat concerned about the integrity of his shoulder construct. He presents today in this regard.    Pertinent Medical History: Right  knee pain, ophthalmic disorders, microcytosis, bleeding disorder, erectile dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer, and nephrolithiasis.    Pertinent Surgical History: Radical prostatectomy, laparotomy, meniscectomy, total shoulder replacement, and revision knee total joint replacement.    Medications: Prilosec, Cialis, Lipitor, Detroit , and multivitamins.    Allergies: Fentanyl and morphine.    Social History: The patient uses neither alcohol or tobacco.    14-point review of systems was consistent with the chief complaint and pertinent medical history.      On physical examination, the patient is awake, alert and oriented. He has 180 degrees of abduction of the shoulders bilaterally, 180 degrees of forward flexion bilaterally, 50 degrees of external rotation bilaterally, and is able to reach T4 with both hands on testing of internal rotation. He has a strong belly press and lift-off. Reese's and Kazmi were negative. He had an equivocal Speed's sign and equivocal Yergason's sign.    We had a long discussion with the patient regarding his activities at this time. We do not feel that his hardware has failed in any way, but he clearly has wear of the glenoid replacement. When questioned, the patient notes that he does significant, heavy weight lifting and also pushups on a daily basis. We discussed this and recommended that the patient take up lighter weights with higher repetition which would most likely provide him with adequate tone while protecting his replaced joints.    At this point, the patient most likely has some rotator cuff tendinitis. We will have him back off his activities at this time and use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as necessary. We invited him to return on a yearly basis for a hardware check or sooner if the need arises as his surgeon has since left the area.    Thank you, once again, for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. If you  have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.    I, Tommy Meadows, NP, acted as scribe for this visit.

He sees flashes when he is working out; otherwise, no new ocular complaints.     The past surgical, medical, family, social history were reviewed.     Social History: He had a left knee performed in 03/11/2008. He had robotic prostate cancer performed at Sequoia Hospital earlier this summer.     Past Medical History: He had prostate cancer; otherwise, noncontributory.    Complete review of systems is similarly noncontributory, except as noted above, since 02/25/2006.          On  examination today I performed OCT testing, slit lamp biomicroscopy, 90-diopter lens evaluation, binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy with 360 degree evaluation of the ora serrata, and I noted the following findings: The visual acuity in the right eye is 20/20. The left eye is 20/40, pin hole to 20/30. Intraocular pressures show mild asymmetry: 15 in the right eye, 13 in the left eye. He has vitreous separations bilaterally, epiretinal membranes bilaterally, nuclear sclerotic cataracts bilaterally, trace posterior subcapsular cataracts bilaterally, chorio-retinal scar in the right eye, and a nice encircling scleral buckle effect in the left eye without any retinal breaks.     At this time, I am going to maintain him on retinal detachment and infection warnings and then have him follow up here with us in 1 year. He has my cellphone number.    Action Items: OCT testing.

Fortunately, the retina remains attached for 360° in both eyes. He has monovision using the left eye for near in the right eye for distance with a -7 refraction in the left eye. Both eyes have cataracts which are not visually significant. He has epiretinal membrane in both eyes again which are not visually significant. Similarly, the right eye has a chorioretinal scar had both eyes have vitreous detachment without evidence of sequential retinal break or retinal detachment. I am going to maintain him on retinal detachment warnings, and slight grade testing, and then return here in 2 years and repeat optical coherence tomography testing.    Assessment  1.

The test is performed by      forcing a blood sample through a hole in a membrane coated with      collagen and either ADP or epinephrine. The endpoint of the test is      the time required for the platelet plug to form and stop flow through      the hole.      This test is prolonged in patients with disorders of primary      hemostasis (e.g.,  inherited and aquired platelet function defects,      Monisha Mize  disease).       The test is not specific; further investigation is required to define      the cause of a prolonged closure time, for example platelet      aggregometry in cases of suspected primary platelet dysfunction or      assessment of von Willebrand factor in suspected von Willebrand      disease.

As you know, this is a very pleasant, 62-year-old, right-handed, real estate executive who had a left total shoulder replacement in 2005. He recently had a knee placing revision performed by Dr. Linker's office and was somewhat concerned about the integrity of his shoulder construct. He presents today in this regard.    Pertinent Medical History: Right  knee pain, ophthalmic disorders, microcytosis, bleeding disorder, erectile dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer, and nephrolithiasis.    Pertinent Surgical History: Radical prostatectomy, laparotomy, meniscectomy, total shoulder replacement, and revision knee total joint replacement.    Medications: Prilosec, Cialis, Lipitor, Pryor , and multivitamins.    Allergies: Fentanyl and morphine.    Social History: The patient uses neither alcohol or tobacco.    14-point review of systems was consistent with the chief complaint and pertinent medical history.        On physical examination, the patient is awake, alert and oriented. He has 180 degrees of abduction of the shoulders bilaterally, 180 degrees of forward flexion bilaterally, 50 degrees of external rotation bilaterally, and is able to reach T4 with both hands on testing of internal rotation. He has a strong belly press and lift-off. Funk's and Grider were negative. He had an equivocal Speed's sign and equivocal Yergason's sign.    We had a long discussion with the patient regarding his activities at this time. We do not feel that his hardware has failed in any way, but he clearly has wear of the glenoid replacement. When questioned, the patient notes that he does significant, heavy weight lifting and also pushups on a daily basis. We discussed this and recommended that the patient take up lighter weights with higher repetition which would most likely provide him with adequate tone while protecting his replaced joints.    At this point, the patient most likely has some rotator cuff tendinitis. We will have him back off his activities at this time and use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as necessary. We invited him to return on a yearly basis for a hardware check or sooner if the need arises as his surgeon has since left the area.    Thank you, once again, for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. If you  have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.    I, Glennon Dingler, NP, acted as scribe for this visit.

As you recall, Mr. Julius is a very pleasant 62-year-old man who has had a number of orthopedic injuries requiring multiple knee replacements and left shoulder replacement, as well as history of a left orbital fracture and detached retina in 2004, and is concerned due to a number  of aortic aneurysms on his father's side of the family.     Mr. Julius is a very active gentleman. He exercises a significant amount. He did the swim from Henderson  2 years in a row and bikes 30-50 miles per week without any difficulty or symptoms.     Past medical history notable for a left knee replacement in 2008, left shoulder replacement 2004, right knee replacement 2005 and 2010, prostatectomy for prostate cancer in 2008 and a ""scleral buckle"" in 2007.     Social history as in HPI and lifelong nonsmoker. No alcohol, no recreational drugs.     Family history notable for a father who was 6'2"" and died at age 85, was a smoker and had a lower AAA. His mother died at 92, she was 5'5"" and she had multiple sclerosis. A paternal uncle was 6'2"", died at age 88, and had a lower abdominal aortic aneurysm, and aortic and mitral valves replaced in his 70s. He has a paternal aunt who was 5'11"" inches, who was very tall and with long fingers, he died at age 51, sudden death but also had Tapia's disease. This was in the early 70s at Stanford. He has a paternal grandfather who had an iliac aneurysm repaired, and his first cousin on his father's side who in his mid 50s had a carotid aneurysm repair.     Medications are allopurinol and Lipitor 20 mg daily. He has had an allergic reaction to fentanyl and morphine.     On exam, his height is 184 cm, arm span of 196.5 cm, that is an arm span to height ratio of 1.07. Upper segment measured 83 cm, lower segment 101 cm with an upper segment to lower segment ratio of 0.82. His weight is 87.7 kg. His pulse is 79, blood pressure 124/66, respirations 16 and 97% on room air. In general, he is alert and oriented x3, in no apparent distress. HEENT: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits. His palate is normal. It is not high arched. There is very mild dental crowding. The patient has never had orthodontia. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air movements throughout.  Cardiovascular: Regular rate, S1S2 auscultated. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Skin: No striae atrophicae. Skeletal: He does not have any pes planus, no hindfoot deformity. Halluces are proportional. He has a negative wrist sign and thumb sign. Negative thumb-to-wrist sign. No hypermobile joints.     Labs were reviewed. Last cholesterol panel was 11/11/2009 with a total cholesterol of 148, LDL of 94, HDL of 47, and triglycerides of 85. His echo from yesterday, 10/16/2010, was reviewed and shows an aortic root that measures 4 to 4.1 cm with trace AR. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Left ventricular systolic function is normal.     On portable ultrasound device in our clinic today, we ultrasounded his abdominal aorta, which appears to be normal size with no evidence of aneurysm. His carotids also appear to be normal size with no aneurysmal dilatation.     In summary, Mr. Pickett is a very pleasant, 62-year-old man who is very active with multiple orthopedic injuries in the past but no known history to be suggestive of Marfan syndrome. In fact, his transthoracic echocardiogram is reassuring as he does not have the characteristic aortic dilatation, with a z-score of approximately 1.5. On ultrasound in our clinic today, he does not have a dilated abdominal aorta or carotids either, areas in which his family have had aneurysms. We have reassured Mr. Naik that his presentation is not characteristic of Marfan syndrome. However, we have asked him to try to obtain pathology from his cousin's carotid aneurysm repair. This may be helpful in trying to determine what caused that as that is a somewhat unusual aneurysm to have. Otherwise, he does not require any followup and was again reassured.     It was a pleasure meeting Mr. Reardon today, and please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any concerns or questions.

The consultation request was for assistance in managing the patient's right knee pain. The patient was seen in conjunction with the attending physician, Dr. Glen Losey, who was present for all aspects of the evaluation. Although you are familiar with the patient's medical history, we will review it here for our medical records.    Mr. Rylie Lang is a 62-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for prostate cancer, now in remission, bilateral knee replacements, and shoulder replacements. The patient presents today complaining of pain in his right knee after he underwent his second right knee replacement on 09/09/2010.  Prior to this, the patient states that he had a long history of knee pain. He notes that after surgery he was taking OxyContin 20 mg twice a day and Percocet. Since that time, he has weaned down so that he is now taking a half a tablet of Percocet every 3 days. The patient notes that he was referred to our clinic by Dr. Zanni, his orthopedic surgeon, for assistance in managing his knee pain.    The patient describes his knee pain as a dull  aching sensation that sporadically comes and goes. He notes that the pain is typically worse at night, making it difficult for him to sleep. He states that during the day he is able to ignore his pain for the majority of time, however, he notes that his pain is worsened when he is standing for long periods of time (2 hours) and when he is doing range of motion exercises as his rehabilitation. He notes that his pain is relieved with a half a tablet of Percocet. On average, he states that his pain is typically a 3/10 but may escalate up to a 10/10 when he is doing his range of motion exercises. He denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats, or leg weakness. He states that his knee is often warm, and he wears a compression stocking to decrease the swelling.    The patient states that the following medications have been helpful for his pain: Advil and Percocet. He notes that he often took stronger opiate medications during his operation and in the immediate perioperative period including fentanyl patches, Vicodin, morphine, OxyContin and Darvon, however, these stronger medications often made him vomit.    He notes that although physical therapy has worsened his pain with range of motion exercises, he has noticed an overall improvement in his range of motion and his ability to do various exercises. He further notes that he often ices his knee and remains active doing exercises and deep tissue massage to relief his pain.    The patient states that he believes that his second knee replacement caused the pain in his right knee. He believes that this will continue to get better as time goes on. He still remains fairly active despite the pain that he has. He is able to swim, participate in rehabilitation, and use an exercise bike. He notes that he is unable to ride his bike outside on the streets until his knee is stronger. He states that he would like to obtain a medication that helps him with his breakthrough pain that he  has during the night. He notes that his goal would be to decrease his pain to at least a 2/10 on a VAS rating scale during that time.    The patient notes that when he takes a half a tablet of Percocet it does relieve his pain and allows him to increase his level of function as well as sleep more effectively. He notes that he has never had a problem with opiates, denies any aberrant behavior or obtaining medications from multiple physicians. He denies any side effects from the medication.    Medications: Lipitor 20 mg q. day, allopurinol 300 mg q. day, multivitamin 1 tablet q. day, Cialis 5 mg q. day, Percocet 5/325 tablet half a tab every 3 days.    Allergies: Morphine causes nausea.    Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia, kidney stone, gastroesophageal reflux occasionally, prostate cancer.    Surgical History: Right shoulder replacement 2004, right knee replacement 2005, 09/11/2010, scleral buckle surgery of the left eye 2005, left knee replacement 2008, prostate cancer surgery 2008.    Family History: Patient has a mother and sister with multiple sclerosis. His father had emphysema.    Sleep History: On average, the patient sleeps 7 hours each night. He notes that he often has difficulty going to sleep initially and maintaining sleep throughout the night secondary to pain. He notes that he often is a restless sleeper because the pain wakes him up. He denies any restlessness of his legs that keeps him awake. He denies any apnea or snoring. He notes that he occasionally takes a 15-minute nap during the daytime.    Social History: The patient states that he had a happy childhood. He denies any sexual or physical abuse, feeling threatened in his environment, contemplating suicide, being psychiatrically hospitalized or participating in psychotherapy. The patient works as a real estate developer. He is married and has 5 children, ages 37, 35, 33, 31, and 27. He denies any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug  use history.    Review of Systems: A 14-point review of systems was discussed with the patient. Please see above history of present illness for pertinent positives and negatives. Additional positives include impotence.    Physical Examination:   Vital signs: Pulse 61, blood pressure 130/78, weight 198, height 6 feet 2 inches.     General: The patient is a well-developed, well-nourished gentleman who appears his stated age, in no acute distress. His affect is normal.   HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, extraocular muscle movements intact, pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Moist mucous membranes. Trachea midline.   Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.   Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.   Skin: No rashes noted.     Musculoskeletal: Patient's lower extremity strength is 5/5 with bilateral hip extension, hip flexion, knee extension, knee flexion, dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. Patient's right knee is warmer than the left and positive edema, mild erythema occurring mainly over the surgical scar site. The patient has multiple well-healed surgical scars on the right knee cap as well as the left knee. No tenderness. No allodynia over the left knee. No pain in the right knee when the scars are pinched. Positive tenderness to palpation along the inferior medial aspect of the right knee and the superior medial aspect. Range of motion of the right knee is zero degrees with extension and approximately 120 degrees with flexion. Unable to internally rotate the right knee. External rotation is approximately 10 degrees.     Neuro: Cranial nerves 2 through 12 intact. Reflexes: 2+ in bilateral patella and ankle. Sensation is symmetric in bilateral lower extremities with the exception of an approximately 4 cm length occurring along the lateral aspect of the midline scar on the right knee, decreased sensation to pinprick and cold in that aspect. Otherwise, the  patient has hypesthesia to pinprick and cold along the medial aspect of his right knee, with positive dysesthesia with palpation. Gait is not antalgic.    Imaging: Right knee x-ray, 10/24/2010: Long leg views demonstrate mild varus deformity of the left knee. Right knee alignment is within normal limits. 3 views of the right knee demonstrate a small joint effusion, right total knee arthroplasty with long femoral and tibial stems show no evidence of hardware complication, old fracture of the right proximal fibula.    Impression: Mr. Tomas Pousson is a 62-year-old fairly healthy gentleman who had a posterior dislocation and needed revision surgery, and most recently underwent another right total knee replacement in 09/11/2010. The patient presents today complaining of episodic pain occurring mostly at night. Based on the patient's physical examination, he would benefit from an antineuropathic pain medication which he could take to help control his pain. This could be taken throughout the day or be taken only at night. We would like to work with the patient's primary care physician to implement the following treatment recommendations.    Plan:  1.  Medications: We recommend the patient initiate gabapentin 300 mg. He may increase this by 300 mg every 3 days, titrated to effective pain relief or side effects. We often do not see results until dosages of at least 2100 to 2700 mg have been reached. Please see the below dose titration schedule for further questions. Possible side effects include dizziness, cognitive dysfunction, sleepiness, or nausea.   2.  Interventions: The patient does not have evidence of a scar neuroma on physical examination. He does have some hypersensitivity along the medial aspect of his knee, which could be effectively relieved with a saphenous nerve block. However, at this time, since the patient's pain is episodic, we will defer doing this. If the patient's pain becomes more  problematic, this could be an option for the future.   3.  Pain psychology: None at this time.  4.  Physical therapy: The patient is currently engaging in aggressive physical therapy, which we encouraged him to do.  5.  Followup: We would like to see the patient again in approximately 5 weeks.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care and management of your patient. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Studies from the 1980's using radioimmunoassay  suggested that vaccine-induced S. pneumoniae  type-specific antibody levels of approximately 2.0  mcg/mL were protective against invasive  pneumococcal disease. Newer methods (Fish and  multiplexed immunoassay) incorporating an  absorption step to remove cross-reactive  antibodies yield results that are comparable to  each other, but are lower than those obtained with  the original radioimmunoassay. Rigorous studies of  protective antibody levels as determined by the  newer methods have not been performed. In addition  to antibody quantity, protection also depends on  antibody avidity and opsonophagocytic activity.     Evaluation of the response to pneumococcal  vaccination is best accomplished by comparing  pre-vaccination and post-vaccination antibody  levels. A 2- to 4-fold increase in type-specific  antibodies measured 4-6 weeks   after vaccination is  expected in immunocompetent adults. The number of  serotypes for which a 2- to 4-fold increase is  observed varies greatly among individuals; a  consensus panel has suggested that individuals  older than 5 years should respond to at least  approximately 70% of pneumococcal serotypes.  Adults >65 years old may exhibit a smaller  (<2-fold) increase in type-specific antibody  levels.     This test was developed and its performance  characteristics have been determined by Focus  Diagnostics. Performance characteristics refer to  the analytical performance of the test.

Responder status is determined according to the ratio of a one   month post-vaccination sample to pre-vaccination concentrations of   Diphtheria IgG Abs as follows:     1. If the one month post-vaccination concentration is less     than 1.0 IU/mL, the patient is considered to be a     non-responder.    2. If the post-vaccination concentration is greater than or     equal to 1.0 IU/mL, a patient with a ratio of less than     1.5 is a non-responder, a ratio of 1.5 to less than 3.0,      a weak responder, and a ratio of 3.0 or greater, a good      responder.    3. If the pre-vaccination concentration is greater than     1.0 IU/mL, it may be difficult to assess the response     based on a ratio alone. A post-vaccination concentration     above 2.5 IU/mL in this case is usually adequate.     Test developed and characteristics determined by ARUP     Laboratories.

This specimen was negative for IgE antibody to Aspergillus (by immunoassay) and IgG antibody to Aspergillus (by immunodiffusion).

On 04/06/1999, the patient developed  the sudden onset of left flank pain which was intense, identical to prior  kidney stones associated with vomiting. He ultimately went to Stanford  emergency room where he was given morphine, Phenergan. Spiral CT confirmed  a 3-4 mm stone at the ureterovesical junction on the left. He  additionally, had multiple small stones in both kidneys. A urinalysis  showed 11-20 red cells per high power field, leukocyte esterase negative  and creatinine was 1.0. His pain largely remitted about 6:00 p.m. Saturday  and he thought he had passed the stone, passing a tiny fleck which he saved  and brings in today. However, he had recurrent pain yesterday which seemed  to be precipitated by urination with spasms in the back. His last severe  pain was about four o'clock this morning although he had some recurrence  today in the office. He has had a dull ache that has been persistent  between the intense spasm. He has been using Vicodin up to two every four  hours for pain relief, no further vomiting. He previously has passed  calcium oxalate stones in 1982 and in 1995 also had a stone which was  confirmed by CT scan again in the left ureterovesical junction. It is not  clear if that stone ever passed. It sounds like this stone is in an  identical location. His CT scan did not demonstrate marked hydronephrosis  recently in the emergency room.    EXAMINATION:  Weight 204, blood pressure 104/64. He appears slightly pale. Chest and  heart are unremarkable. Mild left CVA tenderness. Abdomen is soft. Liver  and spleen are not palpable. Cannot palate the kidneys or bladder.    IMPRESSION:  1. Left ureterovesical junction stone, unclear if this is the same stone  that he had in 1995 which apparently never definitely passed.    Advised - refilled Vicodin, continue to filter urine. If he does not pass  the stone in the next week, will refer to urologist and will also  have  radiology review his CT scans from 1995 and compare with his most recent  scan.    ADDENDUM:  Abdominal CT scan was reviewed by radiologist, Luca Lantz, from 1995, as  well as his most recent one, two days ago. He reports the number of  calcifications in each kidney have increased from about three on each side  in 1995, to five to six on each side at the present time.             It is impossible for him to state with any certainty whether the stone at  the left ureteral pelvic junction is the same stone that was present in  1995.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:1. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate  2. Multivitamin  3. Lipitor 20 mg a day  4. Folic acid 400 mcg a day    He reports that his knee is feeling better. He still has some pain and  occasionally needs Vicodin. He is generally walking without a limp. He  has had some acid reflux for which he takes occasional Pepcid. He went off  Prilosec after the nausea resolved. He has not had any melena. He had a  full colonoscopy 3/03. He has also recently been taking 3 Aleve twice a  day for the last week at the recommendation of Dr. Moffatt's office. He  does not feel that it has been of any help. He also noted that it led to  some fluid retention.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:BP: 130/80. He appears somewhat pale.    LABORATORY DATA:LFTs from 10/13: Normal including alkaline phosphatase.  CBC surprisingly has not improved. His hemoglobin is 12.2, unchanged.  Note: A year ago his hemoglobin was 15.7. His MCV now is slightly low at  79.9. His white count, differential and platelet counts are normal. Note:  He lost a lot of blood at the time of his knee surgery.    IMPRESSION:Persistent anemia. I suspect that he is iron deficient  secondary to blood loss from the knee surgery. An additional possibility  is that he could be having some blood loss from acid reflux.    PLAN:Stool hemoccults x 3. Ferritin iron and transferrin index to be done  today. I will call if there is any change in therapy. He will begin  ferrous gluconate 325 mg at least once and preferably 3 times a day as  tolerated. Stop Aleve and begin Prilosec 20 mg daily. He will have a  repeat hemogram and retic count in six weeks. We will call results.

I have  asked the patient to come back today to discuss his options. He and his  wife were present at the visit. I held a 45-minute discussion with the  patient and his wife regarding his recent diagnosis and what this  entails. I went over the various options including watchful waiting,  radical prostatectomy both robotic and open, and radiation therapy. The  patient has done a great deal of research since I gave him his biopsy  results. He had numerous questions regarding the efficacy of surgery, the  side effects, the side-effect profiles, and treatment to alleviate side  effects of both radiation and surgery. The various risks and benefits to  the surgical approach were discussed including the risks and benefits of  the radiation approach. I gave him the name of Dr. Keaton Orengo in  the radiation oncology department should he wish to pursue more  information regarding that treatment modality.    The patient and his wife had numerous questions which were answered in  detail. He will be letting me know his final decision which I believe  will take several months given the thoroughness of their efforts to  research their options.

His history of urolithiasis dates back to 1982 where he had his  first episode of renal colic with passage of stone, and this recurred in  1995. He recently again passed another stone.    A spiral CT scan was done in the emergency room which did not show any  obvious evidence of obstruction; however, there was evidence of bilateral  small calculi. On deeper cuts, however, there was one cut that did show a  suggestion of a left distal ureteral calculus.    The patient apparently passed the stone one week ago and is now feeling  well. His past medical history is significant only for orthopedic surgery.    On physical examination, there was no costovertebral angle tenderness and  no abdominal masses. A rectal examination showed a 20 to 25 gram, smooth,  benign-feeling prostate. Genital exam showed the right testis to be  somewhat smaller and softer than the left. A urinalysis in the office was  negative microscopically as well as biochemically.    In order to more fully evaluate his recurrent episodes of urolithiasis, we  sent his stone off for analysis. I have arranged for him to undergo renal  ultrasound and KUB to be absolutely sure that he has passed all stone  fragments that were possibly in his ureter and there is no residual  hydronephrosis. Pending these results, we will arrange for him to undergo  two 24-hour urine collections for metabolic evaluation.    Thank you for allowing me to participate in this gentleman's care and I  will keep you informed of his further progress.

As you know, this is a very pleasant, 62-year-old, right-handed, real estate executive who had a left total shoulder replacement in 2005. He recently had a knee placing revision performed by Dr. Vickery's office and was somewhat concerned about the integrity of his shoulder construct. He presents today in this regard.    Pertinent Medical History: Right knee pain, ophthalmic disorders, microcytosis, bleeding disorder, erectile dysfunction, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, prostate cancer, and nephrolithiasis.    Pertinent Surgical History: Radical prostatectomy, laparotomy, meniscectomy, total shoulder replacement, and revision knee total joint replacement.    Medications: Prilosec, Cialis, Lipitor, Gulfport , and multivitamins.    Allergies: Fentanyl and morphine.    Social History: The patient uses neither alcohol or tobacco.    14-point review of systems was consistent with the chief complaint and pertinent medical history.    On physical examination, the patient is awake, alert and oriented. He has 180 degrees of abduction of the shoulders bilaterally, 180 degrees of forward flexion bilaterally, 50 degrees of external rotation bilaterally, and is able to reach T4 with both hands on testing of internal rotation. He has a strong belly press and lift-off. Osborne's and Jackman were negative. He had an equivocal Speed's sign and equivocal Yergason's sign.    We had a long discussion with the patient regarding his activities at this time. We do not feel that his hardware has failed in any way, but he clearly has wear of the glenoid replacement. When questioned, the patient notes that he does significant, heavy weight lifting and also pushups on a daily basis. We discussed this  and recommended that the patient take up lighter weights with higher repetition which would most likely provide him with adequate tone while protecting his replaced joints.    At this point, the patient most likely has some rotator cuff tendinitis. We will have him back off his activities at this time and use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as necessary. We invited him to return on a yearly basis for a hardware check or sooner if the need arises as his surgeon has since left the area.    Thank you, once again, for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.    I, Akiva Sorial, NP, acted as scribe for this visit.

You made referral to the Greenfield   on 06/05/2004. My partner, Dr. Yutaka Laskey, evaluated him for  rhegmatogenous retinal detachment sparing the macula on the left eye. He  scheduled him for surgery; I was in the operating room at that time, and in  order to facilitate more speedy repair I performed the surgery yesterday.  This surgery consisted scleral buckle, cryotherapy, drainage, air placement  and paracentesis in the left eye. I noted that during the case he had  nasal retinal detachment of the left eye, extending between 6 o'clock and  12:30 moving clockwise. There was a horseshoe tear in the 10 o'clock  meridian with a more posterior same meridian atrophic break. At the  termination of the procedure both breaks were supported on the buckle  element; the retina was attached to 360 degrees, and the nerve was well  perfused.    On examination this morning his best corrected visual acuity is 20/150 in  the left eye, consistent with postoperative day results, and his  intraocular pressure is 15. He has 2+ injection of the conjunctiva. The  cornea is clear. The lens has 2+ nuclear sclerotic, 1+ cortical changes.  The retina is attached to 360 degrees with the 287 tied element extending  between 7 and 11:30, with the horseshoe tear and the atrophic break  supported at 10 o'clock. There is an approximately 25% air bubble, and  there is a 360-degree encircling 240 band with a 70 sleeve at approximately  the 5 o'clock position. There is no subsensory fluid noted, and the macula  is attached.    Impression is rhegmatogenous retinal detachment of the left eye, sparing  the macula. He is postoperative day #1 from  scleral buckle, cryotherapy,  drainage and air paracentesis with an attached retina, no evidence of  suction and good intraocular pressure.    Zeitlin, at the time of surgery he still had early subretinal band at  approximately the 11 o'clock position; however, at the termination of the  case the band was flat, and there was no traction. It is not as evident  today. My plan is to advise him as to the signs and symptoms of retinal  detachment in either eye, including flashing lights, floating spots,  decreased vision and/or a curtain or a shadow over his visual field. I am  going to put him on activity restrictions for the next month, have him face  down and/or any position but on his back for the next day or so. He can be  upright and then take Econopred q.i.d., atropine b.i.d. and Vigamox q.i.d.  and then follow up here with me in one week and with you as previously  arranged. If you have any questions regarding this, please feel free to  contact me. Again, thank you for considering Stanford in your  consultation.

I saw him for  follow-up on 02/25/2006. My history and physical are reported below.    CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR EVALUATION: Follow-up of rhegmatogenous retinal  detachment repair in the left eye.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He had an orbit fracture and cheek fractures  on the left side approximately 25 years ago and then subsequently underwent  LASIK in both eyes. On 06/05/2004, he was diagnosed with a  rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the left eye, for which he underwent  scleral buckle, cryotherapy, and drainage procedure by me. He has been  largely asymptomatic with intermittent infrequent flashes in the left eye,  but the visual acuity has been essentially unchanged. As you are aware, he  has monovision with the left eye being used for near and the right eye for  distance.    Other diagnoses include posterior vitreous detachment and nuclear sclerotic  cataracts in both eyes.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes hypercholesterolemia.    PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes:  1. Left shoulder.  2. Toenail surgery in 06/11/2004.    3. The previous repair of the orbit fracture approximately 25 years ago.  4. Right knee operation in 08/11/2005.    FAMILY HISTORY: His mother had age-related macular degeneration, was  pseudophakic, and had multiple sclerosis. His sister had multiple  sclerosis.    SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married with 5 children. He denies tobacco,  alcohol, or drug use. He works as a real estate developer.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He had the knee surgery back in 08/11/2005.  Otherwise, he specifically denies new constitutional, HEENT, respiratory,  cardiovascular, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, hematologic,  endocrine, cutaneous, or  psychiatric problems.    MAJOR FINDINGS/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Best corrected visual acuity in the  right eye is 20/25, left eye is 20/40. Extraocular motility is full in  both eyes. Visual fields are full by confrontation in both eyes. Lampley  pressure in the right eye is 13, left eye is 14. Pupils are equal, round,  and reactive to light and accommodation without afferent pupillary defect.  He has normal mood, affect, and orientation x3 for his age. External  examination reveals normal bony and soft tissue in both eyes with a mild  depressed maxilla on the left side.    Slit lamp biomicroscopy demonstrates there is normal lid, lash, and  lacrimal anatomy and function in both eyes. The conjunctivae and sclerae  are quiet in both eyes. The corneas demonstrate LASIK surgical incisions  in both eyes. Otherwise, the cornea, epithelium, Navarrete's, stroma,  Descemet's, endothelium, and tear film layer are clear in both eyes. The  anterior chambers are deep and quiet in both eyes. The irides are round  and symmetric with no evidence of neovascularization in both eyes. He has  trace nuclear sclerotic changes in both eyes with trace posterior  subcapsular changes on the left side. The anterior vitreous is clear in  both eyes.    DILATED FUNDUS EXAMINATION: RIGHT EYE: The media is clear. There is a  Weiss ring. The cup-to-disk ratio is 0.2. The margins are pink and sharp.  There is a mild epiretinal membrane inferior to the center of the fovea,  and there is a choroidal scar approximately 50 microns in diameter in the  far temporal periphery of the macula.    There is normal caliber and distribution of the retinal vessels. There is  no evidence of retinal breaks or tears with a normal periphery.    LEFT EYE: The media is clear. There is a Weiss ring. The cup-to-disk  ratio is 0.2. The foveal reflex is blunted, but there is no evident  epiretinal membrane. There is normal caliber and distribution of the  retinal vessels.  There is a 360-degree encircling scleral buckle effect  with a tire effect between 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock with the break flat on  this at the 10:30 position. No new breaks, tears, or evidence of retinal  detachment is noted, and the periphery is otherwise normal.    IMPRESSION: He is doing quite well following rhegmatogenous retinal  detachment repair in 06/11/2004. He does have posterior vitreous  detachments in both eyes and very minimal cataracts. He also has an early  epiretinal membrane in the right eye of no visual significance at this  time.    PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:  1. History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair, left eye  (361.00).  2. Posterior vitreous detachment in both eyes (379.21).  3. Epiretinal membrane, right eye (362.56).  4. Choroidal scar, right eye (363.30).  5. Nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes (366.16).  6. Posterior subcapsular cataract, left eye (366.14).    PLAN: At this time, we have reviewed the signs and symptoms of retinal  detachment, specifically increase in flashing lights, increase in floaters,  decrease in vision, curtain, shadow, shade, and decrease in either eye. He  should contact us immediately and not wait to see if it gets better. Even  if it does improve, he should still contact us for evaluation. Otherwise,  I feel quite happy to see him in 1 year's time.    Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.    Very truly yours,        Wiley M.

He dislocated his prosthetic total  knee replacement 10 days ago. Dr. Olden his orthopaedist reopened the  knee and replaced one of the plastic services with a larger size that will  prevent dislocation. Litwiller tolerated that procedure remarkably well and is  ambulating with a cane.    He reports that his bowel movements have been fairly regular. He has not  been straining. No abdominal pain. He has never had hemorrhoids before.      PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 199 pounds. Blood pressure 120/78. Pulse was 72 and regular.  GENERAL: He looks well. EXTREMITIES: Right knee incision is healing  nicely. RECTAL: The perirectal area is unremarkable except for a  thrombosed hemorrhoid that is external at 9 o'clock. Digital examination  confirms no rectal masses. The hemorrhoid is only modestly tender.    IMPRESSION:   1. Thrombosed hemorrhoid.    PLAN:  I advised hot sitz baths and observation. Anticipate resolution over the  next week. He would prefer not to do anything surgical at this point.          F. Sinnett Pattee, M.D.            cc:    F.

Fortunately, the retina remains attached for 360° in both eyes. He has monovision using the left eye for near in the right eye for distance with a -7 refraction in the left eye. Both eyes have cataracts which are not visually significant. He has epiretinal membrane in both eyes again which are not visually significant. Similarly, the right eye has a chorioretinal scar had both eyes have vitreous detachment without evidence of sequential retinal break or retinal detachment.

He saw me in Jan and we treated for presumed pneumonia with levaquin. He got better, but then 10 days ago he developed night sweats and a new cough productive of yellow sputum. He saw Dr. Holbrook in my absence and a CXR revealed a small RLL infiltrate. She put him on 10 days of Avelox. He has completed the antibiotics but feels like it is a slow recovery still. He notes that his cough is better and now only productive of white phlegm. He had nasal congestion but that is better. He has taken a break from his exercise and wonders when he can start again. He notes no wheezing. He wonders why he has had so many recurrent infections. Recall that he had a left lingular infiltrate possibly 1 year ago-- on comparison to old films it was reported as not different but then with follow up it was reported to clear up.     .

There is an area of linear atelectasis or scarring at the right base that was seen previously on the 04/11/2013 film but not before. A small patchy area of airspace disease is present in the right lower lobe that was not seen previously. A linear area of scarring is present on the left side and is stable. The remainder of the lungs is  clear. The heart is normal in size and configuration. The aorta is not dilated. No mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. No pleural effusions.   IMPRESSION: New small area of airspace disease at the right base. Additional scarring at the right base and in the left lower zone is stable.    Impression:  1. Right base pneumonia: improved with Avelox. We had a long discussion about what the right next step is. With so mny chest infections, and a slightly low O2 sat in all these episodes given his degree of fitness, we could check CT scan once CXR has been done; we could also have him see Dr. Cellini to eval his immunity. We will await CXR. Pneumovax given now that he is 65.     Patient Instructions   1. Pneumonia vaccine today    2. Repeat CXR end of 03/30/2024. I will decide after xray about CT scan vs visit with the Allergist/Immunologist (vs both)       We spent 25 minutes together, >50% spent in counseling and coordination of care re: the above issues.

As you know, Prince G Slomka is a 67 Y male with a history of chronic rhinosinusitis, GERD, 5-6 years of recurrent lower resripatory tract infections, and hypertension who was originally referred on 02/22/2016 urgently for CT findings of left greater than right basilar opacities on chest CT with a possible cavitary lesion. He underwent bronchoscopy the same day and started an aggressive airway clearance regimen.    Since seeing the patient last on 02/22/2016 a CT of the chest has been repeated that demonstrates significant improvement in the basilar opacities, but with some residual scarring. On 03/14/2016 he stopped all airway clearance therapies, but felt his symptoms quickly worsened with increased cough and sputum. Of note, all infectious serologies from the BAL have returned negative. Since last seeing him the coccidioidomycosis compliment fixation IgG titers have returned at 1:2.    Today he saw that he is doing well and is back to working out 3x rather intensely and is not limited. He was concerned because in late April he again developed increasing rhinorrhea which he though would prompt another lower respiratory tract infection. He was fortunately able to manage this with both nasal rinses, nasal steroids, and airway clearance therapies.     Finally, the is performing the airway clearance maneuvers once a day in the morning. He uses a xopenex inhaler followed by a 20 minute regimen of nebulized 3% hypertonic saline. His usually prompts 30 to 40 minutes of heavy coughing. He reports clear and occasionally thick white sputum.      Past Medical History:    1. Potential necrotizing pneumonia: LRTI in 11/11/2015 while in Utah,  refractory to Augmentin x 10 days x 2, Levofloxacin x 10 days. Progressive cough, sputum, and fevers. Eventual CXR and CT 02/18/2016 showing left lower lobe cavitary opacity with extensive tree in bud opacities. Bronchoscopy on 02/22/2016 unrevealing. Aggressive airway clearance maneuvers with resolution in opacities on 03/06/2016.  2. Recurrent sinusitis with intermittent complication of lower respiratory tract infetions  3. Reported recurrent bronchitis / lower respiratory tract infections dating to ~2008. Reports 1-2 per year with on average 2-3 courses of antibiotics (Augmentin and Moxifloxacin) yearly  4.

Assessment:    1. Bilateral tree-in-bud opacities with left lower lobe consolidation and cavitation on CT 02/18/2016. Preceded by 3 months of subacute cough and fever. Query aspiration pneumonia with abscess, primary necrotizing pneumonia, or atypical endobronchial process.Status post bronchoscopy 02/22/2016. Near resolution on imaging 03/11/2016.  2. Imaging demonstrating  recurrent left lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray dating to 2013  3. Diffuse basal airway thickening, chronic bronchitis versus bronchiectasis  4. Development of mild OVD on PFT 02/21/2016, new versus 05/18/2015  5. Recurrent LRTI dating to 2008 s/p many courses of antibiotics  6. History of coccidioidomycosis with IgG 1:2 02/11/2016  7. Up to 4 mm pulmonary nodules seen on CT from 03/06/2016  8. Never smoker  9. GERD    Discussion:    Unclear what pathogen was responsible for findings in 02/11/2016. BAL sensitivity may have been blunted by ongoing antibiotics. Also possible would be anaerobic infection or atypical infection (cocci?). It is worth noting though that the patient's chest films demonstrates recurrent left lower lobe infiltrate dating as far back as 2013, which correlates with his history of recurrent sinusitis followed by LRTI.    He is doing well today. The airway clearance regimen may be too aggressive at this point. Would however favor continuing this at a lower level (albuterol followed by acapella device each morning). Although the degree of airway disease is not severe on CT scan, would still escalate back to hypertonic saline if he has increased sputum or sputum changes color.    It may be possible that the original infectious process was due to cocci - although would expect the titer to be higher given the patient had be ill for 3 months when the lab was drawn.     Finally, as there are still residual nodules, and basal scars, we have recommended a repeat CT scan in 6 months time with follow up. He should also have repeat PFTs.     Plan:  1. De-escalate airway clearance to albuterol followed by flutter valve  2. If increasing sputum, dyspnea, or change in color of sputum, restart hypertonic saline  3. Repeat CT scan in 09/11/2016 (ordered)  4. Repeat PFTs (ordered)  5. Change from xopenex to albuterol due to cost concerns  6. Referral to ID due to Cocci CF Ab of 1:2; question would be if whether treatment is  warranted at this point.

He follows with us for chronic bronchiectasis and a prior left lower lobe cavitary lesion concerning for necrotizing pneumonia.    He is a 68 Y male with a history of chronic rhinosinusitis, GERD, 5-6 years of recurrent lower resripatory tract infections, and hypertension who was originally referred on 02/22/2016 urgently for CT findings of left greater than right basilar opacities on chest CT with a possible cavitary lesion. He underwent bronchoscopy the same day and started an aggressive airway clearance regimen.    He was last seen in clinic on 06/16/2016. At that time we felt he was doing relatively well, and de-escalated his airway clearance regimen to albuterol with the flutter valve after. He was seen by ID for a cocci CF (IgG) titer of 1:2, who felt that the diagnosis of active coccidioidomycosis in 02/11/2016 was unlikely to to lack of exposure piror to illness, the IgM was negative, the IgG was low titer, and prior histo exposure in the midwest may have created a false positive. A repeat CT scan was obtained in 09/11/2016 and PFTs were obtained. There was improvement in the nodularity of the lungs.    Today, he reports that his is doing well. He has again swum Eckert  for the 7th time, and had no problems. He has an intermittent cough and is not having to use use his airway clearance very regularly. He had his flu vaccine. Finally, he's started aggressive nasal clearance using a Navage device. No fevers, chills, chest pain.       Past Medical History:    1. Potential necrotizing pneumonia: LRTI in 11/11/2015 while in Utah, refractory to Augmentin x 10 days x 2, Levofloxacin x 10 days. Progressive cough, sputum,  and fevers.

He sees flashes when he is working out; otherwise, no new ocular complaints.     The past surgical, medical, family, social history were reviewed.     Social History: He had a left knee performed in 03/11/2008. He had robotic prostate cancer performed at Sequoia Hospital earlier this summer.     Past Medical History: He had prostate cancer; otherwise, noncontributory.    Complete review of systems is similarly noncontributory, except as noted above, since 02/25/2006.    On examination today I performed OCT testing, slit lamp biomicroscopy, 90-diopter lens evaluation, binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy with 360 degree evaluation of the ora serrata, and I noted the following findings: The visual acuity in the right eye is 20/20. The left eye is 20/40, pin hole to 20/30. Intraocular pressures show mild asymmetry: 15 in the right eye, 13 in the left eye.

He has been very active over the years, but about 4 weeks ago had some catching in his groin of the right hip. He is feeling better now but wanted to have this checked out. He is very active, working out at the gym and swimming 3 times each respectively each week. He does not do impact loading sports.     Clinically, his right knee is doing very well and is not inflamed. Range 0-110 degrees easily. The right hip has a satisfactory range from 0 to about 100 degrees, internal rotation 20 degrees, external rotation 45 degrees, abduction 45 degrees without pain. Sciatic and femoral nerves working well.     Radiographs of the hips show some medial degenerative arthritis of both hips equally.     I reassured Mr. Swanson that there was nothing severe happening with his right hip, and he will return to normal activities. I will see him again at his next routine followup for his knee.

Tuason is a 74 Y male who presents via video visit for for discussion of referral to Stanford physiatry.  The patient is a very active and athletic 74-year-old man who has had numerous orthopedic injuries over the past decades.  He has had a left shoulder replacement, as well as bilateral knee replacements and subsequent revisions in both knee.  He had a significant traumatic injury a couple of years ago resulting in a left olecranon process fracture, as well as multiple closed fractures of his right ribs, and a vertebral compression fracture at L1 and T10.  Despite his multiple injuries and orthopedic surgeries, the patient is very fit.  He swims, runs, uses weights, and otherwise actively works out several days a week.  He has a Centerville  that he also uses.    The patient tells me that most days of the week, he wakes up feeling very sore and stiff, primarily in his shoulders, as well as his back.  He usually gets in the hot tub first thing in the morning, and after 10 minutes in the hot tub, he feels  much better.  He has been able to go about his day, and he is able to exercise without significant pain.    He is worried that the current exercise regimen that he is doing might cause subsequent joint damage down the line.  What he would like his to see a sports medicine specialist who can evaluate his joints, and his exercise routine, and let him know if there are any exercises or movements that he is doing that ultimately might cause harm.

I will refer him to Dr. Beggs in the physical medicine and rehab department at Stanford.  I will defer further imaging to him.  Additionally, I have given the patient name of a private physiatrist in Ladera Ranch , Dr. Kunal Fan.    - Referral To Physical Medicine & Rehab    I personally spent a total of 27 minutes which includes face-to-face time and non-face-to-face time spent on preparing to see the patient, reviewing prior notes and tests, obtaining history from the patient, performing a medically appropriate exam, counseling and educating the patient, ordering medications/tests/procedures/referrals as clinically indicated, and documenting information in the electronic medical record.

He is very worried about recurrent pneumonia. He had pneumonia diagnosed in January. He took a total of 17 days of Levaquin before he finally felt better. He states that it was a very long recovery for him. He had just gotten back into biking and swimming and his other usual activities, when he started to feel a cough coming on, early this week. The cough has been keeping him up at night. He also feels exhausted. He is not short of breath. He denies fevers. He has had an occasional sweating episode at night but nothing drenching.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed and updated in Epic. He does not have any history of lung problems.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A pleasant man in no acute distress. Breathing comfortably. BP is 142/86, pulse of 54, temperature 98.1, weight is 210 pounds. O2 saturation is 95% on room air, which was rechecked and replicated. His oropharynx is clear. Mucous membranes are moist. NECK: Supple. No lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no rales, rhonchi, or wheezing. LOWER EXTREMITIES: No edema.    IMPRESSION: Cough in the setting of pneumonia about 2 months ago. His previous pneumonia was not imaged, so I would like to go ahead and do an x-ray today to evaluate the cough and look for any underlying pulmonary pathology. His O2 saturation is borderline low, which is also a little bit concerning although looking through his past O2 sats, he really never gets above 97 over the last few years, and as mentioned above, he does not feel short of breath. I will be in touch with him with a plan for antibiotics after his x-ray is back. Meanwhile, I have also sent over some Tussionex to his pharmacy per his request. This has worked well for him in the past when he has had trouble sleeping due to cough.

INTERVAL HISTORY: The patient is approximately 2 weeks status post the above surgery. The patient's pain is minimal. He has been compliant with nonweightbearing of his left upper extremity and has weaned out of a sling. He has also been compliant with active flexion and passive extension of his left elbow. He denies fevers, wound issues, numbness, or paresthesias.    PHYSICAL EXAM: The left olecranon incision is healing appropriately with Steri-Strips and sutures intact. There is no surrounding erythema or purulence. The left elbow arc of motion is from 5-100 degrees. The patient is able to clench his fist, abduct all fingers against resistance, and flex and extend his thumb. Sensation is intact to light touch to the radial, medial, and ulnar nerve distributions.    IMAGING: Left elbow x-rays today show maintained reduction of fracture. Implants are intact with no change in alignment or broken implants.    ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Orla Treiber is a 72-year-old male who is approximately 2 weeks status post irrigation and debridement, and open reduction and internal fixation of his left olecranon fracture, progressing appropriately.    The patient's sutures were removed today and he tolerated this well. The patient will continue nonweightbearing on his left upper extremity for 8 weeks postop. He will also continue active flexion and passive extension of his left elbow. After 8 weeks from date of surgery, he may progress to weightbearing as tolerated, and also gradual resumption of physical activities. I have given him a physical therapy prescription with these instructions. The patient will return to clinic in 6 weeks for a repeat exam and new left elbow x-rays. The patient's questions were answered.     The patient was seen in conjunction with Dr. Kelly, attending surgeon.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS/ES: Severe lateral compartment arthritis, left  knee, with large lateral meniscus tear, chondromalacia of femoral condyle  and tibial plateau with anterior synovitis.    OPERATION PERFORMED:   1. Arthroscopy left knee.  2. Anterior synovectomy.   3. Debridement of femoral condyle and tibial plateau.   4. Lateral meniscectomy.    SURGEON: Rylie Boswell, M.D.    ASSISTANT(S):    ANESTHESIA: General inhalation.    ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Julian Guy, M.D.    FINDINGS:    PROCEDURE: The patient is brought to the operating room and in the supine  position, satisfactory general inhalation anesthesia was induced. The left  leg was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. The leg was  stabilized in the leg holder. A 30-degree Stryker arthroscope was  introduced through standard anterolateral portal and instrumentation was  performed through an anteromedial portal. The underside of the patella had  diffuse grade 3 chondromalacia. The femoral groove had grade 3 and grade 4  changes over about 80% of the femoral groove. This was consistent with the  preoperative x-rays that showed significant arthritis of the knee, both  laterally and in the patellofemoral joint. There was moderate synovitis.  There was about 30 cc of synovial fluid in the knee joint that was  evacuated from the joint at the time of arthroscopy.    Attention was turned to the medial gutter. The medial femoral condyle and  tibial plateau had grade 1 changes. The medial meniscus was well  visualized, probed and found to be intact. There was considerable  anterior synovial thickening and fibrosis. This was debrided off the  anterior medial joint line, anterior inner condylar notch and off the  anterolateral aspect of the joint, as well. The ACL appeared to be intact.  The leg was placed in a varus position and immediately encountered was  exposed bone on the femoral condyle  and tibial plateau laterally. This was  debrided with a full radius shaver off both surfaces, removing the loose  fibrillated cartilage. This was done to stabilize the loose cartilage  flaps around the edges, but most of the weightbearing surface was  basically bone on bone. There was a large lateral meniscus tear of the  posterior horn that was extended into the joint. Some of this was  calcified. It was grabbed with a straight basket and 15-degree up-biting  basket forceps. The meniscus debriders were then used to tape the meniscus  fragment and the full radius shaver smoothed down to a good stable rim  posteriorly. A small loose body was identified posteriorly and also  evacuated from the joint. The joint was then debrided further with the  full radius shaver. Both gutters were inspected and no other loose  bodies encountered and no other fragments. The port sites were then closed  with Steri-Strips, Betadine gel and sterile dressing. The patient was  taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.    ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 30 cc.    COMPLICATIONS: None.

He said he has been having this cough for 6 or 7 weeks. He saw Dr. Gilman 2 weeks ago and was given a Z-Pak and Tussionex and inhaler. He went to Wyoming, came back, and does not really feel like the Z-Pak did anything. The Tussionex is helpful but he has run out of it, and he says he is just coughing more than ever and he is really having a lot of pain in the left lower lung area. He has not had fever, no nasal congestion. Initially there was some yellow phlegm coming up and now it is occasionally yellow phlegm, but feels wet but he is not able to mobilize his secretions. He has had occasional subjective low-grade fevers, but the cough has really been bothering him. Medications and medical history were all reviewed on Epic.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Well-appearing man in no acute distress. Blood pressure is 119/74, pulse 68, temperature is 98.2, weight 202 pounds. O2 saturation 97% on room air. His lungs are completely clear to auscultation bilaterally.     We did go ahead and get a chest x-ray, which showed a possible early lingular infiltrate.    IMPRESSION: Possible early lingular pneumonia. At this point, I am going to give him Levaquin 750 mg 1 p.o. daily for a week. I am going to refill his Tussionex because he said that was helpful at suppressing his cough.

He recently underwent a renal ultrasound which showed no  hydronephrosis and no obvious ureteral calculi. His KUB did show what  appeared to be a small stone in the region of the lower pole of the right  kidney. The patient overall is currently feeling well.    In light of his stone history, I elected to perform two 24-hour urine  collections for metabolic evaluation. I will discuss the results with him  once I receive them and otherwise plan to see him again in about 6 months'  time for a recheck KUB.

I saw him for followup  on 02/25/2006. My history and physical are reported below.    CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR EVALUATION: Followup of rhegmatogenous retinal  detachment repair in the left eye.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He had an orbit fracture and cheek fractures  on the left side approximately 25 years ago and then subsequently underwent  LASIK in both eyes. On 06/05/2004, he was diagnosed with a  rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the left eye, for which he underwent  scleral buckle, cryotherapy, and drainage procedure by me. He has been  largely asymptomatic with intermittent infrequent flashes in the left eye,  but the visual acuity has been essentially unchanged. As you are aware, he  has monovision with the left eye being used for near and the right eye for  distance.    Other diagnoses include posterior vitreous detachment and nuclear sclerotic  cataracts in both eyes.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes hypercholesterolemia.    PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes:  1. Left shoulder.  2. Toenail surgery in 06/11/2004.  3. The previous repair of the orbit fracture approximately 25 years ago.  4. Right knee operation in 08/11/2005.    FAMILY HISTORY: His mother had age-related macular degeneration, was  pseudophakic, and had multiple sclerosis. His sister had multiple  sclerosis.    SOCIAL HISTORY: He is married with 5 children. He denies tobacco,  alcohol, or drug use. He works as a real estate developer.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He had the knee surgery back in 08/11/2005.  Otherwise, he specifically denies new constitutional, HEENT, respiratory,  cardiovascular, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, hematologic,  endocrine, cutaneous, or psychiatric problems.    MAJOR  FINDINGS/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Best corrected visual acuity in the  right eye is 20/25, left eye is 20/40. Extraocular motility is full in  both eyes. Visual fields are full by confrontation in both eyes. Klim  pressure in the right eye is 13, left eye is 14. Pupils are equal, round,  and reactive to light and accommodation without afferent pupillary defect.  He has normal mood, affect, and orientation x3 for his age. External  examination reveals normal bony and soft tissue in both eyes with a mild  depressed maxilla on the left side.    Slit lamp biomicroscopy demonstrates there is normal lid, lash, and  lacrimal anatomy and function in both eyes. The conjunctivae and sclerae  are quiet in both eyes. The corneas demonstrate LASIK surgical incisions  in both eyes. Otherwise, the cornea, epithelium, Fitzsimmons's, stroma,  Descemet's, endothelium, and tear film layer are clear in both eyes. The  anterior chambers are deep and quiet in both eyes. The irides are round  and symmetric with no evidence of neovascularization in both eyes. He has  trace nuclear sclerotic changes in both eyes with trace posterior  subcapsular changes on the left side. The anterior vitreous is clear in  both eyes.    DILATED FUNDUS EXAMINATION: RIGHT EYE: The media is clear. There is a  Weiss ring. The cup-to-disk ratio is 0.2. The margins are pink and sharp.  There is a mild epiretinal membrane inferior to the center of the fovea,  and there is a choroidal scar approximately 50 microns in diameter in the  far temporal periphery of the macula. There is normal caliber and  distribution of the retinal vessels. There is no evidence of retinal  breaks or tears with a normal periphery.    LEFT EYE: The media is clear. There is a Weiss ring. The cup-to-disk  ratio is 0.2. The foveal reflex is blunted, but there is no evident  epiretinal membrane. There is normal caliber and distribution of the  retinal vessels. There is a 360-degree encircling  scleral buckle effect  with a tire effect between 7 o'clock and 11 o'clock with the break flat on  this at the 10:30 position. No new breaks, tears, or evidence of retinal  detachment is noted, and the periphery is otherwise normal.    IMPRESSION: He is doing quite well following rhegmatogenous retinal  detachment repair in 06/11/2004. He does have posterior vitreous  detachments in both eyes and very minimal cataracts. He also has an early  epiretinal membrane in the right eye of no visual significance at this  time.    PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES:  1. History of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair, left eye  (361.00).  2. Posterior vitreous detachment in both eyes (379.21).  3. Epiretinal membrane, right eye (362.56).  4. Choroidal scar, right eye (363.30).  5. Nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes (366.16).  6. Posterior subcapsular cataract, left eye (366.14).    PLAN: At this time, we have reviewed the signs and symptoms of retinal  detachment, specifically increase in flashing lights, increase in floaters,  decrease in vision, curtain, shadow, shade, and decrease in either eye. He  should contact us immediately and not wait to see if it gets better. Even  if it does improve, he should still contact us for evaluation. Otherwise,  I feel quite happy to see him in 1 year's time.    Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.    Very truly yours,        Turek M. Giannotti, MD      cc:   Mckayla G.

As you recall, Mr. Speed is a very pleasant 62-year-old man who has had a number of orthopedic injuries requiring multiple knee replacements and left shoulder replacement, as well as history of a left orbital fracture and detached retina in 2004, and is concerned due to a number of aortic aneurysms on his father's side of the family.     Mr. Speed is a very active gentleman. He exercises a significant amount. He did the swim from Conway  2 years in a row and bikes 30-50 miles per week without any difficulty or symptoms.     Past medical history notable for a left knee replacement in 2008, left shoulder replacement 2004, right knee replacement 2005 and 2010, prostatectomy for prostate cancer in 2008 and a ""scleral buckle"" in 2007.    Social history as in HPI and lifelong nonsmoker. No alcohol, no recreational drugs.     Family history notable for a father who was 6'2"" and died at age 85, was a smoker and had a lower AAA. His mother died at 92, she was 5'5"" and she had multiple sclerosis. A paternal uncle was 6'2"", died at age 88, and had a lower abdominal aortic aneurysm, and aortic and mitral valves replaced in his 70s. He has a paternal aunt who was 5'11"" inches, who was very tall and with   long fingers, he died at age 51, sudden death but also had Prabhakar's disease. This was in the early 70s at Stanford. He has a paternal grandfather who had an iliac aneurysm repaired, and his first cousin on his father's side who in his mid 50s had a carotid aneurysm repair.     Medications are allopurinol and Lipitor 20 mg daily. He has had an allergic reaction to fentanyl  and morphine.     On exam, his height is 184 cm, arm span of 196.5 cm, that is an arm span to height ratio of 1.07. Upper segment measured 83 cm, lower segment 101 cm with an upper segment to lower segment ratio of 0.82. His weight is 87.7 kg. His pulse is 79, blood pressure 124/66, respirations 16 and 97% on room air. In general, he is alert and oriented x3, in no apparent distress. HEENT: No jugular venous distention. No carotid bruits. His palate is normal. It is not high arched. There is very mild dental crowding. The patient has never had orthodontia. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally with good air movements throughout. Cardiovascular: Regular rate, S1S2 auscultated. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Skin: No striae atrophicae. Skeletal: He does not have any pes planus, no hindfoot deformity. Halluces are proportional. He has a negative wrist sign and thumb sign. Negative thumb-to-wrist sign. No hypermobile joints.     Labs were reviewed. Last cholesterol panel was 11/11/2009 with a total cholesterol of 148, LDL of 94, HDL of 47, and triglycerides of 85. His echo from yesterday, 10/16/2010, was reviewed and shows an aortic root that measures 4 to 4.1 cm with trace AR. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Left ventricular systolic function is normal.     On portable ultrasound device in our clinic today, we  ultrasounded his abdominal aorta, which appears to be normal size with no evidence of aneurysm. His carotids also appear to be normal size with no aneurysmal dilatation.     In summary, Mr. Speed is a very pleasant, 62-year-old man who is very active with multiple orthopedic injuries in the past but no known history to be suggestive of Marfan syndrome. In fact, his transthoracic echocardiogram is reassuring as he does not have the characteristic aortic dilatation, with a z-score of approximately 1.5. On ultrasound in our clinic  today, he does not have a dilated abdominal aorta or carotids either, areas in which his family have had aneurysms. We have reassured Mr. Speed that his presentation is not characteristic of Marfan syndrome. However, we have asked him to try to obtain pathology from his cousin's carotid aneurysm repair. This may be helpful in trying to determine what caused that as that is a somewhat unusual aneurysm to have. Otherwise, he does not require any followup and was again reassured.     It was a pleasure meeting Mr. Tison today, and please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any  concerns or questions.

The patient reports an ingrown hair on his right neck that has been present for the last 4 days. It is nontender and it is not associated with fever. He has been treating this with a warm soak. He was concerned though because he has 3 prosthetic joints. Also, the patient reports a cough for the last month that started out with a URI, but nasal congestion and sore throat have improved.     CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Allopurinol and atorvastatin.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient is well-appearing, no acute distress. Pulse 80, blood pressure 134/88. HEENT: There were no oral lesions. NECK: Had a erythematous papule with minimal induration with no fluctuance. There was no purulent discharge. Nodes: There was no cervical adenopathy. CHEST: Lungs are clear to auscultation.     ASSESSMENT:   1. Skin lesion. The patient has mild folliculitis. At this point he does not appear to have developed any significant furuncle. It does not appear to be an area amenable to incision or drainage or even requiring antibiotics at this point. He was advised to continue placing warm soaks and to expect this to resolve over the next several days. He will call sooner though should he notice increasing size of the lesion, fevers or other concerning new symptoms.   2. Cough.

Following his surgery physical therapy  was apparently quite intense the first day. Following the therapy he had  rather severe pain in the calf. In retrospect Sewell thinks that it is from  over stretching those muscles because he had had a slight flexion  contracture for years due to his bad knee. He had to take some fairly high  doses of narcotics, which led to nausea. He was discharged home basically  unable to engage in physical therapy due to the amount of discomfort. He  has continued to have intermittent nausea and fairly severe pain. I  prescribed Duragesic because of his difficulty taking Vicodin, 50 mcg  patches. He applied one last night, but had to take it off at 5:00 in the  morning because he was feeling very lightheaded and nauseated. He has been  using Phenergan for the nausea. His last episode of emesis was two days  ago. Bowel movements have been regular. No fever, chills, abdominal pain.  Fortunately his leg pain is gradually improving and has gotten along with  only one Vicodin 5/500 today. At that dosage he can tolerate it without  nausea. He has had a lower extremity ultrasound, which has excluded DVT.    CURRENT MEDICATIONS:1. Low molecular weight heparin  2. Vicodin  3. Multivitamin  4. Lipitor 20 mg a day  5. Folic acid 400 mcg a day    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:BP: 110/80. Temperature: 97.8. Heart rate: 80.  He looks slightly pale. No icterus. He appears in no acute distress.  Chest: Clear. Heart: Regular. Abdomen is soft, liver and spleen are not  palpable, no tenderness. Lower extremities: Incision over the right knee  is healing, no evidence of infection. The knee is warm. No palpable cords  or edema in the calf.    ADDENDUM TO HISTORY:He has had some reflux and has been taking some  over-the-counter Pepcid AC, about 2  per day.    IMPRESSION:Persistent nausea probably multifactorial including intolerance  to higher doses of narcotics and GE reflux. Rule-out any liver function  abnormalities.    PLAN:Advised he will have a comprehensive metabolic panel and CBC today.  Call if any significant abnormalities. He will continue with Vicodin on a  p.r.n. basis and Phenergan p.r.n. nausea. I recommended Prilosec  over-the-counter 20 mg once a day for GE reflux and he will call if  symptoms are not improving. He will be following up with his orthopedist,  Khari Didonato as well.          F. Lavie Valenti, M.D.            cc:    F.

He was well until the morning of 7/27  when he developed acute onset of right flank pain following urination. It  was classic for his renal colic, which he has had in 1982 and in 1995. It  was associated with vomiting. He went to Stanford Emergency Room where he  received intravenous pain relief. An abdominal CT scan confirmed a 4 mm  right ureteral vesicle junction calculus with mild hydronephrosis and  perinephric stranding. There was some new scarring along the lateral  aspect of the upper pole of the left kidney and a nonobstructing 2 mm  calculus in the lower pole of the left kidney otherwise stable bilateral  renal calculi. He was discharged with Vicodin and Phenergan and generally  felt progressively better and yesterday evening he was feeling quite well  until he developed chills and temperature of 101 this morning.

IMPRESSION:Fever and chills status post renal stone which I suspect has  been passed into the bladder given the fact that he is having no further  colic. Probable urinary tract infection,  although current urine is fairly  unimpressive.    PLAN:Advised continue to filter urine, push fluids, begin Cipro 500 b.i.d.  He will call to report progress in about three days and we will advise  results of urine culture at that time and whether he needs to continue with  Cipro.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Zaida is a 66-year-old with cough and postnasal drainage, who presents for initial consultation request Dr. Derwin Amico.     The last 3 years, the patient has gotten recurrent pneumonia. This year he did not have pneumonia, but he became sick in March with a viral infection. He was placed on an antibiotic, which he believes was Augmentin with no change in symptoms. He has had a cough since that time. 3 weeks ago, he was on a second course of Augmentin along with prednisone taper, which caused no change in symptoms. He tried Egnar  and multiple cough medications without response. He complains of postnasal drainage, clear rhinorrhea, cough productive of clear sputum. It happens throughout the day, but is increased when lying flat. No associated shortness of breath, chest tightness, or wheeze. No history of asthma. He also has rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itchy eyes. He does have a history of recurrent pneumonia. He has not had an immunodeficiency workup.     Patient also has a history of possible Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Complete review of systems positive for fatigue and history of GERD.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Prostate cancer, nephrolithiasis, ED, hyperlipidemia, GERD, facial fractures, and history of recurrent pneumonia.    MEDICATIONS: Sinus rinses, NyQuil, Wright  250/50, Ambien as needed, Lipitor 20 mg daily, allopurinol 3 mg daily, and multivitamin. Fitz has been ordered, but not tried.  He is using a hydrocodone cough syrup as needed.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 125/74, pulse 76, oxygen saturation 96%. GENERAL: Well-appearing male in no respiratory distress. EARS: Tympanic membranes clear with an intact light reflex. OROPHARYNX: Mild erythema in the posterior pharynx. Nasal mucosa normal. NECK: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. RESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or rhonchi  noted. Good air movement. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. NEURO: Grossly intact. PSYCHIATRIC: Mood pleasant. SKIN: Clear. EYES: Conjunctivae clear.    DIAGNOSTIC TESTING: Percutaneous skin prick testing was performed to the standard 48 allergen panel. This was negative.     PFTs with FVC of 112% predicted, FEV1 of 111% predicted, FEV1 to FVC ratio of 99% predicted. Post bronchodilator challenge showed a 4% increase in FEV1. Interpretation: Normal spirometry, no significant change on bronchodilator challenge.     Exhaled nitric oxide elevated at 47 parts per billion, indicating allergic inflammation of the airways.     Chest x-ray normal. 05/17/2024, CT scan of the sinuses with trace benign sinus disease.    IMPRESSION: Zaida is a 66-year-old with nonallergic rhinitis, cough, postnasal drainage, reactive airway disease, and recurrent infections who presents for initial consultation.    For cough, suspect this is multifactorial with possible contributors of reactive airway disease, post inflammatory response, rhinitis, and laryngopharyngeal reflux. Start Dymista 1 spray twice daily, continue sinus rinses, add Prilosec 1 tab twice daily. For reactive airway disease, continue Painesville  250/50 one puff twice daily.     For recurrent infections, will do immunodeficiency workup. He will follow up within 1-2 months. If there is no change, consider CT scan of the chest.     Total face-to-face time with patient was 80 minutes, with greater than 50% of this time spent discussing etiologies of cough and treatment options.

However, the patient said that the failure was due to wear on the component and given that he had more components in his shoulder, he was concerned and wanted to have someone take a look at his shoulder.     The patient, overall, says he has been functioning fairly well. He remains an avid exerciser doing pull-ups, push-ups, free weights, as well as using a chain saw and doing tree work occasionally.     The patient has a minimum of pain complaints of the shoulder. He says that occasionally he will have an ache at night, but his activities of daily living are not impacted.     Regarding the implant, itself, the patient underwent surgery at Macon  with Dr. Padda. At the time, he was diagnosed with a biceps tear, as well.     The patient denies any numbness or tingling.     REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A new patient questionnaire was reviewed. The review of systems was positive for changes in hearing over time, glaucoma, and prostate trouble (patient is a survivor of prostate cancer).     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   1.  Prostate cancer.   2.  Arthritis.   3.  Nephrolithiasis.     SURGERIES:   1.  Left shoulder replacement, 2004.   2.  Left knee replacement, 2008.   3.  Right knee replacement, 2006, revision 2010.   4.  Rhinoplasty, 1970.   5.  Eye surgery, left eye, 2004.   6.  Prostate resection, 2009.     MEDICATIONS:   1.  Lipitor 20 mg daily.   2.  Allopurinol 300 mg  daily.   3.  Cialis 5 mg daily.   4.  Multivitamin.     FAMILY HISTORY:   1.  Emphysema.   2.  CHF.  3.  Multiple sclerosis.     SOCIAL HISTORY: Tobacco Use: None. Alcohol Use: None. The patient is married and lives with his wife and golden retriever.     PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 195 pounds, height 6 feer 2 inches. The patient is well developed and well nourished. His respiratory rate is unlabored. His peripheral pulses are intact. Examination of his left shoulder shows a well healed surgical mid axillary incision. The patient has excellent range of motion and can fully flex and abduct the shoulder to 170 degrees which is symmetric with the right side. Patient has internal rotation to T8 bilaterally and external rotation to 60 degrees. The patient's isolated supraspinatus, internal rotation, external rotation strength are all 5/5. Patient has mild positive supraspinatus sign with resisted abduction. Speed's test is positive. Kobernick test is positive terminal extension. Yergason's, Justice, apprehension tests are all negative. Patient has a palpable defect in his biceps, but can flex and extend freely. Towle, he has full sensation in both hand with brisk capillary refill.     IMAGING: Examination of the patient's x-rays show no significant migration or wear of the humeral stem which is intact. Overall, there is no catastrophic failure of the implant, although there is a suggestion of uneven wear on the glenoid component.     ASSESSMENT: A 62-year-old male status post left total shoulder arthroplasty.     PLAN: We spoke with Mr. Slaby regarding activity going forward. The patient has clearly had a good result from the index surgery and continues to put a high level of load onto his shoulder through his various activities. However, at this time, he has minimal discomfort and is functioning well. We advised patient to continue activity as tolerated, as activities that do hurt, he generally avoids. We will refer the  patient to Dr. Olivero ,our shoulder and elbow attending for an appointment in mid May. Additionally the patient has the option of sending his x-rays to Dr. Fader, who has since left the area, to see if he would be able to follow up and offer some insight on his current status given that he was the original surgeon.     The patient will follow up in our clinic on an as-needed-basis, but will be seen by our orthopedic surgery specialty shoulder and elbow attending in the coming weeks.       Herman Fleischmann, MD    ATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:    I have personally seen, evaluated, and examined the patient. I am in agreement with the Resident/Fellow's assessment and plan.

He is status post choroidal buckle, cryotherapy and Anjum's  procedure in the left eye on 06/05/2004. His preoperative visual acuity  was 20/100, pin hole to 20/30, and today his manifest refraction sign is  5+1 at 165 for 20/30. He is complaining of some minimal temporal  shimmering as well as some peripheral visual field defect. On examination  today the retina is flat for 360 degrees. There is no evidence of  infection. Intraocular pressure is good at 11. He has mild nuclear  sclerotic changes, and the vision, as previously mentioned, is 20/30. At  this present time I am going to have him be very cognizant of the signs and  symptoms of retinal detachment, including flashing lights, floating spots,  curtain and/or decreased vision. He should contact us immediately for  immediate evaluation, should these occur, and then I am going to have him  follow up with Dr. Zigmund Kono for consideration of contact lens trial to see  if this improves his peripheral visual acuity and/or for evaluation of  distance correction of his monovision of the left eye. Should you have any  questions, please feel free to contact me.        Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.

He recently had an episode of gross, painless  hematuria and my evaluation including flexible cystoscopy was normal.    An intravenous pyelogram again showed a small, approximately 3 mm stone  situated in the lower pole calix of his right kidney. There was no  evidence of obstruction or other lesions involving the urinary tract. His  urine culture was negative, and urine cytology showed only reactive cells.    The patient is feeling well and has had no further bleeding.    I assured him that I was unable at this point to determine any source of  problem within his urinary tract. It is possible that he did have a very  short urinary tract infection that caused him to have gross hematuria.  However, we will follow him carefully and see him again in approximately 6  months' time for a KUB.    Thank you for allowing me to participate in his care.

He was seen by Leveille several weeks ago because of terrible left hip pain with degenerative arthritis mainly medially. He has been trying to manage his symptoms conservatively with pain medication and exercise, but unfortunately this has been insufficient. He is scheduled for total hip replacement on the left next month.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: All listed on the electronic medical record.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL:  Shows that he is healthy appearing. EXTREMITIES:  He has an antalgic gait actually bilaterally. His hips have full restricted painful range of motion, more on the left than the right, with some grinding. Sciatic and femoral nerves no change.    IMAGING: His radiographs show advanced medial type of arthritis, left more than right, with bone-on-bone and cyst formation.    DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATION: I reviewed all the x-rays with the patient and his wife, including reviewing the risks, benefits and other matters related to left total hip replacement. He is scheduled for a few weeks' from now.        Pero, MD, PhD      CC:  Quiros, MD    SJN: [000000]   DJN: 2466  D: 11/12/2023   T: 11/12/2023    / MODL  "

He has felt sick for about a week now. He was exposed to a coworker with a very bad cold and he also reports that he did a 2 mile swim to Selma  a few weeks ago, which may have made him prone to illness. Either way he complains of 1 weeks of sinus pressure, as well as copious rhinorrhea. He states that he has always had trouble with sinus drainage because of a history of breaking his nose twice. The symptoms then progressed to his chest over the last few days and he has had some low grade fevers, about 99.5 two days ago, although it has been normal today. He has not felt short of breath or wheezing. He has no history of asthma and generally describes himself as quite healthy.     His medications include Prilosec, Cialis, Lipitor, allopurinol, and a multivitamin.     PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 122/80, pulse of 72, temperature 97.8, weight is 197, O2 sat 95% on room air. Baseline appears to be 97% on room air. Oropharynx shows some erythema at the anterior tonsillar pillars bilaterally. Mucous membranes are moist. Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy. Tympanic membranes clear bilaterally. Nares some edema and erythema of the mucosa. Maxillary sinuses are not particularly tender. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. He has good air movement throughout and there are no audible rales, rhonchi, or wheezing.     IMPRESSION: Respiratory tract infection. The patient has a low oxygen saturation, which was confirmed on repeat testing by me. In the setting of his cough and chest congestion, this makes me concerned for an early pneumonia. I believe it is early because his lung exam is entirely normal. However, I do think we should treat it aggressively with antibiotics and I have prescribed Levaquin 500 mg daily x10 days. I have also given him a prescription for Tussionex to use for cough suppression at night. I did not order a chest x-ray today because  his lungs did sound quite good, but if his symptoms do not improve or certainly if he feels worse over the next 48 hours, then this would be reasonable to evaluate the extent of the disease. Otherwise if he is improving, he will finish up the course of Levaquin and follow up on a p.r.n. basis.

He has been in a splint at home. He has been comfortable, and his pain has significantly improved. He is now only taking 0 or 1 Percocet per day. He denies any numbness or tingling in his hand and noticed that his swelling has improved. He denies any fevers or chills. He has not noticed any drainage, though he has been in a splint.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Splint is removed today. The incision is healing nicely. There is no drainage. He has some resolving ecchymosis about the elbow as expected for his postoperative state. He is neurologically intact with regard to radial, median, ulnar nerve function. His range of motion is quite good. He is about 5 degree shy of full extension and can flex to greater than 90 degrees. Pronosupination is full.     IMAGING: No images obtained today.    ASSESSMENT/PLAN: Mr. Molony is now 7 days status post irrigation, debridemen and open reduction/internal fixation of his open left olecranon fracture. He is progressing as expected. We reviewed range of motion exercises for him to do at home, which will consist of passive extension as well as active flexion. He will avoid any extension against resistance. We counseled him on wound care and avoiding submerging the incision in water. He will return on 10/08/2024 for removal of sutures and first set of x-rays at that point.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the left eye  , nasally sparing the macula, with horseshoe tear at 10 o'clock and  atrophic break at 10 o'clock in the same meridian as the horseshoe tear,  but more posterior.    PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Scleral buckle, cryotherapy, drainage, and air  tamponade, all in the left eye.    SURGEON: Suzie Bouras, M.D.    ASSISTANT: Pruden, M.D.    ANESTHESIOLOGIST: Koelling, M.D.    TYPE OF ANESTHESIA: Local monitored anesthesia care.    INDICATIONS: The patient is a 55-year-old Caucasian male with a history of  retinal detachment diagnosed on Monday 06/04/2004, by Dr. Vaccarello, referred  in for evaluation with Dr. Billy Goldfarb today at the Oregon   office. He was diagnosed with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the  left eye, sparing the macula, with a horseshoe tear at the 10 o'clock. He  was consented for scleral buckle and cryotherapy in the left eye, and then  referred to the operating room at Stanford where he was introduced to me,  Beckham Yancy. The risks, benefits, alternatives, and complications of  scleral buckle, cryotherapy, drainage, and air tamponade were reviewed with  him in detail including pain, bleeding, infection, decreased vision, loss  of vision, loss of the eye, increased pressure in the eye, decreased  pressure in the eye, failure to achieve the surgical goals, proliferative  vitreoretinopathy, sequential retinal detachment, cataract, cataractous  advancement, lid droop and red eye, poor cosmesis, and change of the  glasses' prescription. Special circumstances in his case are that he has  2+ nuclear sclerotic with mild cortical changes cataracts prior to the  surgery, as well as previous LASIK surgery, and I stressed that he would  likely need some spectacle correction and cataract extraction.  Despite  these risks, he decided to proceed with the procedure with the benefit of  preserving his visual acuity and maintaining retinal attachment.    PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After proper informed consent was obtained, the  patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine  position. At this point, we performed a time-out procedure. I asked him  what his name was. He said that it was Sarah G. Fredericks. I then checked  the wristband on the left wrist, and it said that his name was Nevarez. I asked him which eye had to be operated on was, and he said the l  eft eye was the correct eye. I then looked above the left eye, and he said  yes. I asked him what the procedure was. He said scleral buckle repair of  retinal detachment. I checked the history and physical, the consent, and  the OR schedule. All indicated that the procedure to be performed was  scleral buckle procedure for repair of retinal detachment in the left eye.  The patient asked if there were any dissenters in the room. There were no  dissenters. At this point, the patient was administered a sedative, and th  en I administered 5 mL of retrobulbar block consisting of 0.75% Marcaine  and 4% lidocaine in a 1:1 ratio using a 12-mL syringe and a 25-gauge long  1.5-inch needle. Following adequate akinesia and anesthesia, the patient  was prepped and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. I divided  the 10 x 60 drape using the drape scissors and introduced a wire Barraquer  speculum into the left eye. Then, using the operating room microscope with  a 0.12 forceps and Cilento scissors, I performed a 360-degree conjunctival  peritomy based at the limbus, with relaxing incisions at 3 o'clock and 9 o'  clock. I dissected posteriorly in the 4 oblique quadrants using the  tenotomy scissors. I isolated the 4 rectus muscles using the Nagar musc  le hooks and then secured bridle suture consisting of 0 silk bridle suture  around the 4  rectus muscles. I inspected the 4 oblique quadrants using the  Schepens retractor and noted that there were no abnormal areas of scleral  thinning or ectasia. At this point, I performed indirect ophthalmoscopy  with a 30-diopter lens and the scleral depressor, and noted that there was  a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment that started at 6 o'clock and moved  towards the 12:30 position nasally, in a clockwise manner. There was a  very obvious horseshoe tear in the 10 o'clock meridian. I marked this  using the Savage marking scleral depressor and then the marking pen. I  then performed cryotherapy to this area and the surrounding retina moving  anteriorly from the retinal break and just posterior to the lip of the  horseshoe tear. At this point, I asked for and received a 287 tire, 240  band, and a 70 sleeve, which we placed in a gentamicin bath consisting of  200 mL of balanced salt solution with gentamicin. After these had soaked  for approximately 10 minutes, I then trimmed the 287 so that it would cover  approximately 5 clock hours of the eye, and then placed the 240 band  circumferentially, starting with the inferior rectus muscle moving in a  clockwise direction. I secured the ends of the 240 band using a 70 sleeve  in the inferotemporal quadrant, and then I placed the 287 tire from the 7  o'clock to the 11:30 positions in the left eye under the 240 band. I then  secured the superonasal quadrant using a 5-0 nylon suture 2 mm posterior to  the muscle insertions with approximately 9 mm of imbrication. I left this  on a serrefine, and then I performed under the microscope a scleral cutdown  using a #64 blade and saw the choroid, and used a 30-gauge needle under  direct visualization with the TB syringe and the plunger removed, and  performed a drainage procedure. Pigment was noted to egress from the  subretinal space, as well as fluid. I maintained counterpressure on the  globe by placing cotton swabs 180 degrees  opposite. The scleral cutdown  site was at the 11 o'clock position of the globe, superior to the 10  o'clock position where the retinal break was noted. I then secured the  buckle by drawing up the loose ends and then placed permanent sutures all  the way around the eye, performed indirect ophthalmoscopy, and noted that  there was still a considerable amount of subsensory fluid nasally, and  while the 10 o'clock horseshoe tear was well supported on the buckle, there  was a previously unnoted atrophic hole in the exact same meridian at the  apex of the horseshoe tear posterior to the horseshoe tear, which was  elevated above the buckle. I made the decision to cut and remove the  superonasal quadrant 5-0 nylon suture. I drew down the tire element. I  performed additional drainage through the previous drainage site, and I  then replaced the 5-0 nylon suture with an additional 1-mm setback from the  muscle insertions for a total of 3 mm posterior to the muscle insertions  with a total of 9 mm of imbrication. Additionally, in the inferonasal  quadrant, the suture placement was 2 mm posterior to the muscle insertion  with 9 mm of imbrication, and in the superotemporal and inferotemporal  quadrants, the 5-0 nylon suture was placed 3 mm posterior to the muscle  insertion with 2 mm of imbrication to go around the 240 band, which was  only present there, and there was no tire element on that side. Following  the revision, I performed indirect ophthalmoscopy again. I noted that the  retina was completely supported for 360 degrees. The 2 breaks, the  horseshoe tear, and the atrophic break were flat on the buckle. There was  a small nubbin of subsensory fluid in the inferonasal area, but well away  from the area of the retinal breaks, and there was a nice encircling  360-degree scleral buckle effect. I then asked for and received sterile  air on a TB syringe with a 30-gauge needle. I demarcated 4 mm posterior to  the limbus in  the superotemporal quadrant, and then I injected in the mid  vitreous cavity 0.25 mL of sterile air, which formed some fish-egg  formation as it broke up in the mid-vitreous cavity, and then I tamponaded  the sclerotomy site as I was removing the 30-gauge needle from the eye. I  then asked for and received a TB syringe with a sterile 30-gauge needle on  it and preformed a paracentesis straight temporarily at the 3 o'clock  limbus, removed 0.2 mL of anterior chamber aqueous fluid, and then included  the segments of cotton swab that I was removing from the eye. My  assistant, Zion Cirillo, examined the optic nerve head with indirect  ophthalmoscopy and noted that there were no spontaneous venous pulsations,  that the nerve appeared well perfused, and that the retina was attached for  360 degrees with a 360-degree encircling buckle effect. At this point, I  bathed the eye with 100 mL of gentamicin solution and cut and removed the  loose ends of the scleral buckle. I then cut and removed the 4-0 silk  bridle sutures and then had my assistant reapproximate the conjunctiva to  its original position and use interrupted episcleral bites with 7-0 Vicryl  at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions to reapproximate the conjunctiva,  and then at the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions also to reapproximate  the conjunctiva to its original position; and then finally, he used 7-0  Vicryl in buried horizontal mattress suture fashion at the 3 o'clock and 9  o'clock positions to close the radial incisions. I then had him perform  subconjunctival injections inferotemporally of Meeteetse  and infranasally of  dexamethasone, and then the speculum was removed, the patient was undraped,  and subcutaneous surface around the eye was cleansed and then dried, and  then a drop of atropine was placed on to the ocular surface. Then, we  ascertained that the patient did not have any contraindications to  placement of Betoptic S on to the ocular surface. I  also had a ribbon of  antibiotic ointment placed. The eye was patched and shielded. The patient  was discharged to recovery. He given instructions to maintain left  side-down positioning to the extent that he could tolerate this because of  previous shoulder surgery in order to facilitate the greatest tamponade  against retinal break, although face-down positioning also would be  acceptable.    He was also instructed not to engage in any heavy bending, lifting,  straining or otherwise strenuous activity, to keep the eye patched and  shielded, to keep the eye dry, not to rub the eye, and to follow up at the  Grand Prairie  office at the morning of 06/06/2004.

We reviewed his history at great length.    He first saw Dr. Vawter for a plugged ear back in 2015. He had a myringotomy at that time, and the effusion ultimately recurred, so he had a tube placed in 08/11/2015.      He returned in 04/11/2016 and had the tube removed, as he wanted to scuba dive.    He did well until 09/11/2017 when he once again developed a plugged ear on the left. Exam showed an amber effusion. A myringotomy was done. The patient had copious ongoing otorrhea for weeks after that procedure. He was treated with Augmentin and then Nalesnik. Ultimately the drainage stopped, but once again the hearing was poor. When he saw Dr. Purohit on 10/22/2024, an audiogram was ordered.    The patient had the audiogram today and a mixed conductive hearing losses noted in that left ear.    The patient is quite frustrated as he was hoping to fly to Weston  for the weekend to see his grandchildren in a show. Has questions about possible next steps.    The patient does have a history of a facial fracture in the past. Dr. Buehler did consider a temporal bone CT, but this has not been ordered.    Physical Exam:  The patient is comfortable. No distress. The right ear is normal. There is no wax, no debris, no retraction, no effusion. On the left, the tympanic membrane is dull and retracted, and once again there appears to be an amber effusion present. The nose is clear anteriorly with no pus or purulence. The oral cavity shows normal lips, normal palate, normal buccal mucosa, normal tongue. The neck shows no adenopathy. Thyroid is normal to palpation.    Assessment & Plan    1. Seromucinous otitis media, left  - CT ORBITS WO IV CONTRAST; Future  - WOUND CULTURE; Future    2. Conductive hearing loss of left ear with restricted hearing of right ear  I reviewed great length with the patient the findings. We discussed the risk of flying within effusion present. We discussed the  option of canceling the trip. We discussed the option of a myringotomy alone. We discussed the option of a myringotomy and tube placement. We discussed the CT that Dr. Towers had previously recommended.    We did reviewed his recent culture result which did show pseudomonas. We discussed that perhaps myringotomy alone with application of Spring Valley  over the next week could help this heal once and for all without recurrence.    For now, patient elects to have the myringotomy now, use the drops, and have a temporal bone CT early next week. After that evaluation, he could decide whether T-tube placement or evaluation for the eustachian tube dilation should be considered.    As such, I discussed at great length the indications and the risks of a myringotomy with the patient and he wished to proceed. Informed consent was obtained.    Procedure note:    Preop diagnosis: Recurrent left serous otitis    Postop diagnosis: Same    Procedure: Left myringotomy    Surgeon: Zeller Pease M.D.    Anesthesia: Local    Procedure: Patient was positioned under the operating microscope. Phenol was applied to the anterior inferior tympanic membrane. A myringotomy was made. Copious serous otitis was evacuated. There is mild thickening of the middle ear mucosa. Ciprodex drops were applied. He tolerated the procedure well.    Findings: Recurrent amber effusion, moderate thickening of the middle ear mucosa    Estimated blood loss: Less than 1 mL    Complications: None    Disposition: Patient left the clinic in good condition. We discussed the use of Trinidad  for the next week . Prescription done. Patient to call for any problems. Temporal bone CT ordered.

He consented to proceed. He was given a *** enema. The patient  was then placed in the right lateral decubitus position.    Transrectal ultrasound probe was gently inserted into his rectum and  volumed the prostate at 31.6 g. The prostate was then anesthetized with  10 mL of a 9:1 solution of 1% Lidocaine and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. Once  proper anesthesia was achieved, 12 systemic core biopsies were taken from  the apex, mid, and base regions, both medially and laterally, from the  both the left and right lobes of the prostate. The patient tolerated the  procedure with minimal pain and minimal bleeding.    At the close of the procedure, the patient was reminded of the signs and  symptoms of urinary sepsis, urinary retention, and excessive bleeding. He  understands he should call us immediately if any of these should occur.  He will follow up with Dr. Sweet in 1 week's time for the results of this  biopsy.      Fry Y.

The patient was seen by Dr. Eslinger, my colleague, on the 18th. It was thought that the rash was likely secondary to oxycodone that the patient has been taking for 3 weeks for postoperative pain after a left total knee replacement revision. He admits that the pain after this total knee revision is substantially worse than the pain was 8 years ago when he had his first total knee replacement. He had been taking oxycodone 10 mg of the long-acting formulation twice daily with 5 mg of short-acting oxycodone for breakthrough pain throughout the day. However, he developed a rash about a week ago. He stopped the oxycodone altogether on Friday the 18th, and since then his rash has gotten substantially better. He is continuing to take hydroxyzine for the itching.    Dr. Verma gave him a prescription for tramadol to take instead of the oxycodone. He also had him start taking around-the-clock acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The patient is accompanied by his wife today, who tells me that she feels that he is doing okay during the day, but he is having significant pain at night. She is wondering if there is any alteration of the medication regimen that can be done to improve his nighttime pain control.

There is a left juxtacardiac opacity that seems to be present and intermittent since 2013        CT of Chest, 02/18/2016:  ""FINDINGS:     Medical devices: None.     Thyroid: A 3 mm hypodense lesion in left thyroid lobe, too small to characterize.     Lymph nodes:   Small volume lymph nodes are present in the mediastinum measuring up to 9 mm in the low right paratracheal station. Bulky hilar nodes additionally noted. No axillary, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.     Vasculature:   Aorta and main pulmonary artery diameters are within normal range.     Heart:   Mild coronary artery calcification. No pericardial effusion.     Other mediastinal structures:   Normal.     Lung parenchyma: Extensive mixed consolidation and groundglass is present in both lower lobes, more striking on the left. In the left   lower lobe posterior basal segment is an area of dense nodular consolidation measuring approximately 31 mm containing a central   subcentimeter lucency. Background of diffuse centrilobular nodularity which  also extends to involve the right middle lobe. In the right   upper lobe posterior-laterally, there is a cluster of nodules, however a more groundglass appearing nodule measuring 10 mm is   additionally seen (303-1 43). Scattered solid pulmonary nodules bilaterally measuring up to 8 mm in the subpleural left lower lobe   (303-182).     Airways: Severe bronchial wall thickening, most striking in both lower lobes and left greater than right with areas of mucous plugging   and impaction. Mild bronchial wall thickening is seen elsewhere. Central airways are clear. Minimal endoluminal debris within the   trachea.     Pleura: Normal.     Chest wall and spine:   No aggressive bone lesions. Multilevel degenerative change of the thoracolumbar spine. Left glenohumeral joint arthroplasty in place.     Upper abdomen: Normal.     IMPRESSION:  1.  Basilar predominant tree-in-bud and nodular opacities, with airways thickening and mucus impaction, likely representing   bronchocentric spread of infection/inflammation, such as from chronic aspiration. Recommend clinical correlation. There is an area of consolidation in the left lower lobe with focal air lucency, considerations include a area of focal bronchiectasis versus a tiny   cavity from focal necrotizing pneumonia.     2.  Cluster of bronchocentric nodules in the right upper lobe inferiorly and laterally with focal groundglass component measuring   10 mm, likely infectious. Attention on follow-up.     3.  Scattered solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 8 mm in the subpleural left lower lobe. Comparison to priors would be helpful to evaluate for stability. Otherwise CT follow-up in 6 months is suggested.     4.  Upper limit of normal for size mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive.""        CT Chest, 03/06/2016:  IMPRESSION:  1.  Interval improvement in bibasilar tree-in-bud nodular opacities with improved airways thickening and mucus impaction likely    representing improving bronchocentric spread of infection/inflammation.  2.  Interval improvement in the cluster of bronchocentric nodules in the right upper lobe inferiorly and laterally which likely represents   improving infection.  3.  Redemonstrated prominent mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes which may be reactive.  4.  A few bilateral solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm, which may be infectious in etiology. Recommend follow-up CT chest in one year to assess for resolution and/or stability.""        CT of Chest, 08/28/2016:  1.  Near-complete resolution of previously noted centrilobular nodules. Persistent areas of groundglass with reticulation in right middle lobe and right lower lobe which may represent areas of scarring.     2.  Small, less than 4 mm nodules. Recommend follow-up CT in 12-18 months to demonstrate long-term stability.""     CT Chest, 09/21/2017:     IMPRESSION:    1.  Persistent groundglass and reticulation in the right middle and lower lobes that is unchanged from 08/28/2016 and likely represents postinfectious/inflammatory scarring.    2.  Numerous pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm that are unchanged from 02/18/2016. In the absence of clinical risk factors for cancer, no additional follow-up is required per Fleischner Society guidelines.

Prior Non-Resolving Pneumonia. Bilateral tree-in-bud opacities with left lower lobe consolidation and cavitation on CT 02/18/2016. Preceded by 3 months of subacute cough and fever. Plain film imaging demonstrates recurrent left lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray dating to 2013, leading to suspicion of focal  bronchiectasis being nidus. Status post bronchoscopy 02/22/2016 without causative organism (in setting of ongoing antibiotics). Consolidation and airways disease has improved with primarily airway clearance alone.  2. Mild to Moderate Focal non-CF Bronchiectasis; bronchiectasis workup non revealing. Likely related to prior infection.  3. Development of mild OVD on PFT 02/21/2016, new versus 05/18/2015, due to 1 & 2, nearly resolved on PFTs 07/10/2016 (very mild).  4.

Recall, patient had his L knee replaced by Dr. Sandy Moreland in 2008. Prior to his knee replacement he has had up to 3 arthroscopic procedures. His knee replacement had been doing well up until 03/29/2017 he presented to the clinic with acute knee swelling and pain without any trauma or inciting event. Cultures and aspiration workup was negative. Per Dr. Castillo, he has had this aspirated 3 times. Each time, it is 70 to 80 mL of frank blood. The patient does not feel he is doing anything excessive, and these are spontaneous bleeds. He was then referred to Dr. Seeker from vascular surgery where a left lower extremity angiogram was done and revealed ""multiple genicular collaterals around the patient's posterior knee with a prominent AV malformation of the knee joint posteriorly"", at this time a vascular coil block and emobolization of main genicular branch feeding avium on 05/07/2017. Pt has had at least 5 more episodes of bleeds, acute swelling, and increased pain since the coil block. Had a surgical consultation with Dr. Russel Rifai on 05/21/2017, and he recommended a left revision TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY, synovectomy for recurrent effusion and hemarthrosis. Patient has considered all non-surgical interventions and would like to have aformentioned surgery.    Of note, patient has a history of Hyperlipidemia, kidney stones, prostate CA, and gout.

As you know, he is the president and owner of a real estate company, and is 62 years of age and in excellent health. He had a right total knee replacement for degenerative arthritis on 08/26/2005. The Stryker Scorpio posterior stabilized knee was used. Unfortunately, he had a posterior dislocation and needed a revision surgery, which of the tibial spacer. He continues to have problems with the knee and it appears as though the tibial component is loose and the spacer has been extruded. He had some blood work on 08/21/2010, which showed a normal white blood count, a normal hemoglobin and hematocrit. His PT, PTT, and INR were all normal as well. He had a bone density of his right and left hip, which showed some osteopenia, but his spine bone density was normal. There is a family history of osteoporosis.    Because of the above, he has pain in his right knee, all over his knee. He has difficulty walking and exercising and icing is a big part of his knee treatment.     He can walk about 5-10 blocks and has some mild pain. He continues to work out and be as active as he can, and uses no aids. He works out 5 days a week.     He works about 50% of the time. He is married with 5 children. He is a nonsmoker and a nondrinker.     He has had a contralateral left total knee replacement in 07/11/2008, and a shoulder replacement on 05/11/2004.     He has had his prostate removed in 07/11/2008 and had hemorrhage postoperatively. He had a scleral buckle in 2004 in his left eye, and a fractured cheek/skull in 1974. He has had multiple admissions for kidney stones.     His mother had multiple sclerosis. His father had an aortic abdominal aneurysm.     Review of systems  shows that the patient ""tends to bleed post surgery."" He has had kidney stones and prostate cancer with removal. He has had shoulder surgery on the left.     He has allergies to morphine. He has had trouble with pain medications as well. He says he is allergic to morphine and Fentanyl.     He is on allopurinol, Lipitor, and a multivitamin.     He is an extremely healthy male. Clinically, he seems very fit and is about 62 inches tall, 197 pounds. His hips are mobile bilaterally and his left knee has a satisfactory range and stability. The left knee straightens virtually completely and flexes to about 115 degrees. Flexion extension gaps are well balanced.     The left knee is definitely posteriorly subluxated. It is a bit swollen and it is unstable in flexion and extension. I can straighten it virtually completely, and bend it to about 120 degrees, but there is posterior subluxation that is quite noticeable. His foot pulses are palpable. The neurological is normal in the right lower extremity.     His radiographs are quite interesting. These show a tricompartmental Scorpio Stryker total knee replacement. The knee is aligned in slight varus. There is definite loosening of the tibial component with the anterior aspect sinking into the metaphysis and lifting up of the posterior portion of the base plate, such that the stem is touching the posterior cortex. The tibial insert has fractured, or at least slipped out of the alignment housing of the base plate. It is also extruded laterally somewhat. The patella is rather thin; that is his host bone. I have gone over the above with the patient and his wife. It is clear that this patient is in need of revision rather expeditiously. I have told him about this in detail and taken some blood work to rule out a low grade infection. I have told him about revision of both components, that is tibial and femoral, and we will examine the patella as well. I have talked to him about the  pro's, con's, possible complications, blood requirements, and other matters related to the surgery. Questions were asked and answered. We will have him followed by a hospitalist while in hospital here and we will try and get him on the schedule in due course.     Thank you very much for asking me to see this interesting patient.

The consultation request was for assistance in managing the patient's right knee pain. The patient was seen in conjunction with the attending physician, Dr. Konner Ambur, who was present for all aspects of the evaluation. Although you are familiar with the patient's medical history, we will review it here for our medical records.    Mr. Lynn Sima is a 62-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for prostate cancer, now in remission, bilateral knee replacements, and shoulder replacements. The patient presents today complaining of pain in his right knee after he underwent his second right knee replacement on 09/09/2010.  Prior to this, the patient states that he had a long history of knee pain. He notes that after surgery he was taking OxyContin 20 mg twice a day and Percocet. Since that time, he has weaned down so that he is now taking a half a tablet of Percocet every 3 days. The patient notes that he was referred to our clinic by Dr. Wedel, his orthopedic surgeon, for assistance in managing his knee pain.    The patient describes his knee pain as a dull aching sensation that sporadically comes and goes. He notes that the pain is typically worse at night, making it difficult for him to sleep. He states that during the day he is able to ignore his pain for the majority of time, however, he notes that his pain is worsened when he is standing for long periods of time (2 hours) and when he is doing range of motion exercises as his rehabilitation. He notes that his pain is relieved with a half a tablet of Percocet. On average, he states that his pain is typically a 3/10 but may escalate up to a 10/10  when he is doing his range of motion exercises. He denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats, or leg weakness. He states that his knee is often warm, and he wears a compression stocking to decrease the swelling.    The patient states that the following medications have been helpful for his pain: Advil and Percocet. He notes that he often took stronger opiate medications during his operation and in the immediate perioperative period including fentanyl patches, Vicodin, morphine, OxyContin and Darvon, however, these stronger medications often made him vomit.    He notes that although physical therapy has worsened his pain with range of motion exercises, he has noticed an overall improvement in his range of motion and his ability to do various exercises. He further notes that he often ices his knee and remains active doing exercises and deep tissue massage to relief his pain.    The patient states that he believes that his second knee replacement caused the pain in his right knee. He believes that this will continue to get better as time goes on. He still remains fairly active despite the pain that he has. He is able to swim, participate in rehabilitation, and use an exercise bike. He notes that he is unable to ride his bike outside on the streets until his knee is stronger. He states that he would like to obtain a medication that helps him with his breakthrough pain that he has during the night. He notes that his goal would be to decrease his pain to at least a 2/10 on a VAS rating scale during that time.    The patient notes that when he takes a half a tablet of Percocet it does relieve his pain and allows him to increase his level of function as well as sleep more effectively. He notes that he has never had a problem with opiates, denies any aberrant behavior or obtaining medications from multiple physicians. He denies any side effects from the medication.    Medications: Lipitor 20 mg q. day, allopurinol 300 mg q.  day, multivitamin 1 tablet q. day, Cialis 5 mg q. day, Percocet 5/325 tablet half a tab every 3 days.    Allergies: Morphine causes nausea.    Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia, kidney stone, gastroesophageal reflux occasionally, prostate cancer.    Surgical History: Right shoulder replacement 2004, right knee replacement 2005, 09/11/2010, scleral buckle surgery of the left eye 2005, left knee replacement 2008, prostate cancer surgery 2008.    Family History: Patient has a mother and sister with multiple sclerosis. His father had emphysema.    Sleep History: On average, the patient sleeps 7 hours each night. He notes that he often has difficulty going to sleep initially and maintaining sleep throughout the night secondary to pain. He notes that he often is a restless sleeper because the pain wakes him up. He denies any restlessness of his legs that keeps him awake. He denies any apnea or snoring. He notes that he occasionally takes a 15-minute nap during the daytime.    Social History: The patient states that he had a happy childhood. He denies any sexual or physical abuse, feeling threatened in his environment, contemplating suicide, being psychiatrically hospitalized or participating in psychotherapy. The patient works as a real estate developer. He is married and has 5 children, ages 37, 35, 33, 31, and 27. He denies any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use history.    Review of Systems: A 14-point review of systems was discussed with the patient. Please see above history of present illness for pertinent positives and negatives. Additional positives include impotence.    Physical Examination:   Vital signs: Pulse 61, blood pressure 130/78, weight 198, height 6 feet 2 inches.

No pain in the right knee when the scars are pinched. Positive tenderness to palpation along the inferior medial aspect of the right knee and the superior medial aspect. Range of motion of the right knee is zero degrees with extension and approximately 120 degrees with flexion. Unable to internally rotate the right knee. External rotation is approximately 10 degrees.   Neuro: Cranial nerves 2 through 12 intact. Reflexes: 2+ in bilateral patella and ankle. Sensation is symmetric in bilateral lower extremities with the exception of an approximately 4 cm length occurring along the lateral aspect of the midline scar on the right knee, decreased sensation to pinprick and cold in that aspect. Otherwise, the patient has hypesthesia to pinprick and cold along the medial aspect of his right knee, with positive dysesthesia with palpation. Gait is not antalgic.    Imaging: Right knee x-ray, 10/24/2010: Long leg views demonstrate mild varus deformity of the left knee. Right knee alignment is within normal limits. 3 views of the right knee demonstrate a small joint effusion, right total knee arthroplasty with long femoral and tibial stems show no evidence of hardware complication, old fracture of the right proximal fibula.    Impression: Mr. Lynn Sima is a  62-year-old fairly healthy gentleman who had a posterior dislocation and needed revision surgery, and most recently underwent another right total knee replacement in 09/11/2010. The patient presents today complaining of episodic pain occurring mostly at night. Based on the patient's physical examination, he would benefit from an antineuropathic pain medication which he could take to help control his pain. This could be taken throughout the day or be taken only at night. We would like to work with the patient's primary care physician to implement the following treatment recommendations.    Plan:  1.  Medications: We recommend the patient initiate gabapentin 300 mg. He may increase this by 300 mg every 3 days, titrated to effective pain relief or side effects. We often do not see results until dosages of at least 2100 to 2700 mg have been reached. Please see the below dose titration schedule for further questions. Possible side effects include dizziness, cognitive dysfunction, sleepiness, or nausea.     2.  Interventions: The patient does not have evidence of a scar neuroma on physical examination. He does have some hypersensitivity along the medial aspect of his knee, which could be effectively relieved with a saphenous nerve block. However, at this time, since the patient's pain is episodic, we will defer doing this. If the patient's pain becomes more problematic, this could be an option for the future.     3.  Pain psychology: None at this time.    4.  Physical therapy: The patient is currently engaging in aggressive physical therapy, which we encouraged him to do.    5.  Followup: We would like to see the patient again in approximately 5 weeks.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care and management of your patient. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.    Sincerely,    Shanklin, MD  MPH    I was present and actively participated in the care of  this patient. I have reviewed the fellow's history and physical and agree with the documented assessment and plan.

As you know, he is a  59-year-old white male with a history of an elevated PSA. He is here for  further workup and evaluation regarding that issue.    Past Medical History: Osteoarthritis, detached retina,  hypercholesterolemia and nephrolithiasis.    Past Surgical History: Right knee replacement, 09/11/2005. Left  shoulder replacement, 05/11/2004. Scleral buckle, 06/11/2004.    Current medications include Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q. daily, potassium  citrate 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d.    Allergies to morphine.    Family History: Contributory for multiple sclerosis in mother and sister.    Social History: Never smoked. Does not drink. Married and works in real  estate development and regularly exercises.    Review of System: Allergy/Immunology negative. Constitutional negative.  Cardiovascular is negative. Eyes positive for detached retina. Ears,  Nose, Mouth, Throat negative. Endocrine negative. GI negative.  Hematology/Lymphatic negative. Musculoskeletal positive for  osteoarthritis. Neurological negative. Psychiatric negative. Respiratory  negative. Integumentary negative. GU positive for elevated PSA.    Physical Exam: Well-developed, well-nourished white male in no apparent  distress. HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic. Extraocular muscles intact.  Neck is supple. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart is  regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdomen soft,  nontender, nondistended. Back: No CVA tenderness. Extremities: No  clubbing, cyanosis or edema.    I held a 30 minute discussion with this patient regarding his treatment  options. Given his elevating PSA, I have recommended a transrectal  ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate. That was performed today and I  will call him the results in  approximately 1 week when the pathology  report returns.    In the meantime, do not hesitate to contact me if any new questions or  issues arise.

His father has had an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His paternal  uncle had an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His paternal uncle's son just had  a carotid dissection at age 57. His paternal grandfather had a thoracic  aortic aneurysm and his father's aunt has Marfan syndrome. Noor's only  risk factor other than his family history is hypercholesterolemia, which is  under treatment with Lipitor. No history of hypertension and no symptoms.  He is in excellent physical condition. He just returned from a trip to  Mexico where he was helping to build houses and did a tremendous amount of  physical work without difficulty.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:BP: 110/70. Pulse: 70 and regular. Carotids: No  bruits. Abdomen: Soft, no abdominal masses, no bruits.    IMPRESSION:Hypercholesterolemia and strong family history of aneurysm,  carotid dissection.    PLAN:Advised he is still probably relatively low risk, but he is very  anxious to proceed with screening. We will order a carotid and abdominal  aortic ultrasound. Call results.

FINDINGS: Under microscopic visualization the right ear was examined. The patient was found to have an air fluid level from a yellow middle ear effusion. Using phenol a spot on the anterior, inferior aspect of the ear drum was anesthetized. After waiting approximately a minute, a myringotomy incision made in the area of the phenol application. Middle ear fluid was then aspirated with a #3 Frazier suction. Titanium Tytan tube was then placed without difficulty. Patient noted immediate improvement in hearing.    The patient tolerated the procedure well.     There are no complications.     Kleinman T Glod, MD  Patient instructed to keep the ears dry over the next 2 weeks.     "

Overall, he is doing very well. No specific complaints of his knee. He is complaining of some left shoulder pain. He had a left total arthroplasty done at an outside facility in 2004. The physician has since moved away. He was lifting something heavy approximately a month and a half to 2 months ago and has felt some soreness ever since. No significant tearing sensation or other overt injury. He has had no significant change in his range of motion. He is pretty much painfree, just some aching soreness occasionally radiating down around his deltoid tuberosity area.    On physical examination of his right knee, he has full extension and range of motion of 0 to 120 degrees. His surgical incision line is healed well. He has stable flexion/extension. He walks with a smooth gait and he has palpable +2 dorsalis and posterior tibialis pulses. Sensation is intact. He is able to plantar flex and dorsiflex his toes and his ankles. Examination of his left shoulder shows that he has full motion for forward flexion. He has approximately 35 to 40 degrees of external rotation with his elbow at his side. He is able to easily reach up to around T6 for internal rotation. He has no pain with resisted external rotation. He has a negative Quist's test. He does have pain and a little bit of weakness with empty can test on the left compared to the right.     X-rays of the right knee show the implant to be stable and in good alignment.     IMPRESSION: Mr. Sotolongo is 6 months status post right revision total knee arthroplasty to his CCK with stems off at about the tibial and femoral components. Overall doing very well. For his left shoulder pain we have referred him for consultation to Dr. Jack Dixon to be evaluated and seen for this. We did not order any x-rays today, as we did not know what her protocol would be. The patient has a history of complication with  the prosthesis in his right knee, and so he would like to make sure there is no complications with the left total shoulder arthroplasty. We will defer any sort of treatment to Dr. Deignan after her evaluation. We will see Mr. Skipper back in our clinic with Dr. Allis in 6 months at his 1 year followup. At that time we will do a repeat clinical assessment and new x-rays.    This patient was seen and examined by Dr. Lum who is in accordance with the plan.

He was last seen in 08/11/2005 and was diagnosed with  bilateral stones. He was given a prescription of Urocit-K, but did not  take this medication consistently because he had multiple orthopedic  surgeries in the interim. He would like to restart Urocit-K and requested  a refill today. In the interim, he has not had any episodes of kidney  stone pain or passed stones. Otherwise, he feels well. He states that he  has a prostate and PSA check annually and that a recent PSA was elevated,  but he will recheck it in one to two months.    To establish the presence of any stones currently, I have asked Mr. Pirozzi  to proceed with a KUB today. I also refilled his Urocit-K. If all goes  well, he will return to our clinic next year.

He is a 69 Y male with a history of chronic rhinosinusitis, GERD, a 6 year history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and hypertension who was originally referred on 02/22/2016 urgently for CT findings of left greater than right basilar opacities on chest CT with a possible cavitary lesion. He underwent bronchoscopy the same day and started an aggressive airway clearance regimen. Since then his parenchymal and airways disease has improved. He was last seen in clinic on 12/11/2016 at which time we recommended repeating a CT in 09/11/2017 to follow up some chronic pulmonary nodules and scarring.    Today, he is doing well. However, he recently had his apparently 5th knee replacement performed, and because of this has been more sedentary and not swimming as much. He additional had pseudomonal otitis in 10/11/2017 requiring a myringotomy and topical antibiotics. His hearing is slowly improving in this ear.    Otherwise, he denies a significant degree of cough, sputum, wheezing, or dyspnea. He finds he does not need to perform airway clearance maneuvers currently, but will start them immediately if there are any changes in his symptoms. He currently denies any rhinorrhea.       Past Medical History:    1. Left lower lobe pneumonia 02/11/2015. Potentially anaerobic.  · Originally with LRTI in 11/11/2015 while in Utah, refractory to Augmentin x 10 days x 2, Levofloxacin x 10 days. Progressive cough, sputum, and fevers. Eventual CXR and CT 02/18/2016 showing left lower lobe cavitary opacity with extensive tree  in bud opacities. Bronchoscopy on 02/22/2016 unrevealing. Aggressive airway clearance maneuvers with resolution in opacities on 03/06/2016.  2. Recurrent sinusitis with intermittent complication of lower respiratory tract infection. Patient has rightward deviation of his intranasal septum prior to previous facial injury.  3. Reported recurrent bronchitis / lower respiratory tract infections dating to ~2008. Reports 1-2 per year with on average 2-3 courses of antibiotics (Augmentin and Moxifloxacin) yearly from 2008 onward.  4. History of nephrolithiasis.  5. Return of Cocci IgG (CF) titer at 1:2 during workup for necrotizing pneumonia. Patient seen by ID on 06/13/2016 who felt likelihood of active cocci causing the cavitary lesion was low.  6. Dumlao.  7. Hypertension.  8. Mild aortic dilation with mild AR on TTE from 10/16/2010. Followed in vascular surgery Marfan clinic.      Past Surgical History:    1. Rhinoplasty in the 1970s for a broken nose.  2. Left suborbital blowout fracture in 1973 status post surgery.  3. Left shoulder replacement in 2004.  4. Left knee replacement 2008, right knee replacements 2010 and 2012.  5. Total prostatectomy in 2010 for prostate cancer.

There is a left juxtacardiac opacity that seems  to be present and intermittent since 2013      CT of Chest, 02/18/2016:  ""FINDINGS:     Medical devices: None.     Thyroid: A 3 mm hypodense lesion in left thyroid lobe, too small to characterize.     Lymph nodes:   Small volume lymph nodes are present in the mediastinum measuring up to 9 mm in the low right paratracheal station. Bulky hilar nodes additionally noted. No axillary, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.     Vasculature:   Aorta and main pulmonary artery diameters are within normal range.     Heart:   Mild coronary artery calcification. No pericardial effusion.     Other mediastinal structures:   Normal.     Lung parenchyma: Extensive mixed consolidation and groundglass is present in both lower lobes, more striking on the left. In the left   lower lobe posterior basal segment is an area of dense nodular consolidation measuring approximately 31 mm containing a central   subcentimeter lucency. Background of diffuse centrilobular nodularity which also extends to involve the right middle lobe. In the right   upper lobe posterior-laterally, there is a cluster of nodules, however a more groundglass appearing nodule measuring 10 mm is   additionally seen (303-1 43). Scattered solid pulmonary nodules bilaterally measuring up to 8 mm in the subpleural left lower lobe   (303-182).     Airways: Severe bronchial wall thickening, most striking in both lower lobes and left greater than right with areas of mucous plugging   and impaction. Mild bronchial wall thickening is seen elsewhere. Central airways are clear. Minimal endoluminal debris within the   trachea.     Pleura: Normal.     Chest wall and spine:   No aggressive bone lesions. Multilevel degenerative change of the thoracolumbar spine. Left glenohumeral joint arthroplasty in place.     Upper abdomen: Normal.    IMPRESSION:  1.  Basilar predominant tree-in-bud and nodular opacities, with airways thickening and mucus impaction, likely representing   bronchocentric  spread of infection/inflammation, such as from chronic aspiration. Recommend clinical correlation. There is an area of consolidation in the left lower lobe with focal air lucency, considerations include a area of focal bronchiectasis versus a tiny   cavity from focal necrotizing pneumonia.     2.  Cluster of bronchocentric nodules in the right upper lobe inferiorly and laterally with focal groundglass component measuring   10 mm, likely infectious. Attention on follow-up.     3.  Scattered solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 8 mm in the subpleural left lower lobe. Comparison to priors would be helpful to evaluate for stability. Otherwise CT follow-up in 6 months is suggested.     4.  Upper limit of normal for size mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes, likely reactive.""      CT Chest, 03/06/2016:  IMPRESSION:  1.  Interval improvement in bibasilar tree-in-bud nodular opacities with improved airways thickening and mucus impaction likely   representing improving bronchocentric spread of infection/inflammation.  2.  Interval improvement in the cluster of bronchocentric nodules in the right upper lobe inferiorly and laterally which likely represents   improving infection.  3.  Redemonstrated prominent mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes which may be reactive.  4.  A few bilateral solid pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm, which may be infectious in etiology. Recommend follow-up CT chest in one year to assess for resolution and/or stability.""      CT of Chest, 08/28/2016:  1.  Near-complete resolution of previously noted centrilobular nodules. Persistent areas of groundglass with reticulation in right middle lobe and right lower lobe which may represent areas of scarring.     2.  Small, less than 4 mm nodules. Recommend follow-up CT in 12-18 months to demonstrate long-term stability.""    CT Chest, 09/21/2017:    IMPRESSION:    1.  Persistent groundglass and reticulation in the right middle and lower lobes  that is unchanged from 08/28/2016 and likely represents postinfectious/inflammatory scarring.    2.  Numerous pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm that are unchanged from 02/18/2016. In the absence of clinical risk factors for cancer, no additional follow-up is required per Fleischner Society guidelines.       PFTs:     Date FVC (%) FEV1 (%) FEV1/FVC Dsb DsbHb TLC Notes   05/18/2015 6.23 (122%) 4.36 (115%) 0.70 N/A N/A N/A Outside Study   02/21/2016 5.43 (114%) 3.13 (79%) 0.58 27.75 (106%) 17.75 (106%) 9.73 (131%) -ve BDR, Mild OVD   07/10/2016 6.27 (132%) 4.21 (131%) 0.67 33.20 (128%) 33.20 (128%) N/A Mild OVD, Likely BDR       Flow loop, 07/10/2016    Assessment:    1. Prior Non-Resolving Pneumonia. Bilateral tree-in-bud opacities with left lower lobe consolidation and cavitation on CT 02/18/2016. Preceded by 3 months of subacute cough and fever. Plain film imaging demonstrates recurrent left lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray dating to 2013, leading to suspicion of focal bronchiectasis being nidus. Status post bronchoscopy 02/22/2016 without causative organism (in setting of ongoing antibiotics). Consolidation and airways disease has improved with primarily airway clearance alone.  2. Mild to Moderate Focal non-CF Bronchiectasis; bronchiectasis workup non revealing. Likely related to prior infection.  3. Development of mild OVD on PFT 02/21/2016, new versus 05/18/2015, due to 1 & 2, nearly resolved on PFTs 07/10/2016 (very mild).  4. History of coccidioidomycosis with IgG 1:2 02/11/2016, but felt to be unlikely to cause presentation mentioned in #1  5. Up to 4 mm pulmonary nodules seen on CT from 03/06/2016; stable as of 09/11/2017. No further need for follow up CT imaging unless symptoms change.  6. Rightward intranasal septal deviation due to rhinoplasty from prior trauma. Propensity to develop recurrent sinusitis.  7. Left sided otitis requiring myringotomy in 10/11/2017.  8. Never smoker  9. GERD    Discussion:    Mr. Yap continues to do  well. He is now working on regaining his previous level of activity enjoyed in prior years. He has not had a significant recurrence of his pulmonary symptoms in around 2 years. His chest CT scans have remained stable, with only residual scarring remaining from his prior infection. As such, we do not recommend repeating any CT imaging unless he were to have changes in his symptoms. Also, there is no indication at this time for further CT scans for lung cancer screening purposes.    We recommend continuing his aggressive airway hygiene practices as needed - particularly with any increase in rhinorrhea or chest congestion. We recommended that he contact us if he has any new symptoms. Otherwise, we will see him in one years time.    Plan:  1. No further CT imaging required  2. Continue airway clearance maneuvers daily to BID for increased symptoms of cough, sputum, rhinorrhea. His clearance regimen is:  1. Albuterol or levalbuterol via nebulizer  2. 7% saline, via nebulizer  3. Use of aerobika valve or Acapella valve x 20 repetitions  4. Performed a forced ""huff cough"" maneuver  3.

Patient had left total knee replacement on 07/27/2024 and while his recovery is going well, he has had problems with pain control. His most recent regimen included extended release OxyContin with breakthrough oxycodone without Tylenol. He has also been using gabapentin. He has also been taking as needed ibuprofen. He noticed 4 days ago however that a rash appeared on his back, forearms, and hands which he describes as incredibly itchy. He tried Benadryl which only worked mildly. As of yesterday he stopped taking gabapentin and OxyContin but his pain was severe enough that he had to have a oxycodone this morning.      he  reports that he has never smoked. He has never used smokeless tobacco. He reports that he does not drink alcohol or use drugs.

He is a 59-year-old gentleman with stage T1c adenocarcinoma  of the prostate, Hilson 3+4 equals 7. We are consulted regarding the  possibility of definitive radiation therapy for his prostate cancer.    History of Present Illness: 10/11/2003 PSA 2.68, 10/11/2004 PSA 2.35,  04/13/2007 PSA 3.7, 04/20/2007 DRE by Dr. Comas demonstrates  1+ enlarged prostate without nodularity. 06/24/2007 PSA 3.8, 10/14/2007 PSA 4.0, 11/10/2007 the patient seen by Dr. Ory and  biopsies were taken under transrectal ultrasound guidance. The prostate  volume was found to be 31.6 mL. Pathology report notes 3+4 equals 7, 3  out of 12 cores positive, bilateral involvement. In the right apex  medially Gleason 3+4 with 4 mm of 9 mm involved. Left apex laterally  Andrade 3+4 with 4 mm of 8 mm involved. Left mid laterally Wilkerson 3+4  with 2 mm of 3 mm involved. 12/08/2007 the patient is seen by Dr.  Gengler for discussion of therapeutic options. Referrals made to Dr. Loiselle.    Since the biopsy the patient has had no recent UTIs, no fevers and  chills, and minimal urinary symptoms. He has 1 to 2 times nocturia. He  has no erectile dysfunction.    Review of Systems: Aside from the items noted above, the remainder of the  full 14-point review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.    Past Medical History: Nephrolithiasis since 1982, osteoarthritis, retinal  detachment in the left eye status post repair, hypercholesterolemia.    Past Surgical History: Right knee replacement 09/11/2005, left  shoulder replacement 05/11/2004, scleral buckle repair of the left retina  06/11/2004.    Medications:  Lipitor, potassium citrate, multivitamins, and glucosamine.    Allergies: Morphine.    Social History: The patient lives in Brevard . No tobacco or alcohol. He  works in real estate development. He is married with 5 children. He  regularly exercises.    Family History: Significant for multiple sclerosis in mother and sister.    Physical Examination: Vital Signs: Temperature 36.2, blood pressure  113/67, pulse 71, respirations 20, weight 211.1, height 6 feet 1-1/2  inches. KPS 100%. General: Well-appearing, in no acute distress,  pleasant. HEENT: EOMI. Moist mucous membranes. Sclerae anicteric. No  facial rashes or skin lesions. Extremities: Well perfused, no clubbing,  cyanosis or edema. Extremities with gross full range of motion.  Neurologic: Cranial nerves 2 through 12 grossly intact. The patient  ambulates without difficulty. Gait within normal limits. Psych: The  patient without signs of anxiety or depression.    Laboratory Studies: As per above.    Imaging Studies: None were available for review today.    Assessment and Plan: Mr. Pulido is a 59-year-old gentleman with T1c  adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Skoog 3+4 with 3 out of 12 cores  positive and bilateral involvement. His PSA presently is 4.0. We had a  thorough discussion today with Mr. Kijowski regarding the risks, benefits,  short and long-term side effects of both radical prostatectomy and  external beam radiation. We also discussed briefly brachytherapy which we  feel is not an ideal modality for him given his intermediate risk disease  involving bilateral lobes. Of radical prostatectomy and external beam  radiation therapy, we emphasized that the rate of recurrence is identical  and that he needs to make a decision based on the side effect profiles.  For radiation therapy, we would recommend intensity modulated radiation  therapy to the prostate only with concurrent short course of hormonal  therapy with Casodex and Lupron. Hormonal therapy would  begin 2 months  prior to the initiation of radiation therapy and run concurrently with  radiation therapy for 2 additional months. Mr. Kijowski and his wife asked  numerous questions that were answered in detail by Dr. Jen. They will  take some time to consider their options and will contact us when they  have made a decision. They know that they are free in the meantime to  contact us with any questions or concerns.      Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of this  patient. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or  concerns.

Although changes in policy now allow medical notes to be reviewed immediately by patients, please remember that these notes are meant to be a communication tool between medical professionals and require medical terms to be used for efficiency. They are not a comprehensive transcript of your visit.     This is a Telehealth service -- Internal Medicine-- Video Visit    I have conducted this video visit at my office. I have discussed the risks, benefits, and limitations of receiving care via audio and video with the patient. The patient expresses understanding and is willing to move forward. The patient confirms their location is at Patient's Home in California at the time of visit with no other participants involved.    Siri G Ruckman is a 74 Y male who presents via video visit for RSV and influenza A exposure. He had a large family gathering for the Thanksgiving holiday.  One of his grandchildren was confirmed to have RSV and was quite symptomatic, and then another grandchild became ill with similar symptoms.  Another set of grandchildren and their parents were found to have influenza A.    2 days ago, the patient and his wife started to feel ill.  They developed aches, with chills and some sweats overnight.  They felt very fatigued.  They had sore throats.  Yesterday, the patient started coughing quite a lot.  He started using his saline nebulizer machine to prevent any exacerbation of his pre-existing bronchiectasis.  Last night, he took half of a Percocet in order to suppress his cough and be able to sleep.  He thought this worked quite well.  Today he is still coughing somewhat and still achy and fatigued, but does not feel quite as bad.    Has had negative home COVID-19 tests; is vaccinated fully against COVID-19 and  flu.     Problem list, medications, allergies reviewed and updated as appropriate.     Physical Exam:  Video visit -- no vital signs.     GEN: appears well, in no apparent distress, pleasant and cooperative   HEENT: EOMI, conjunctiva clear   RESP: breathing comfortably, speaking in full sentences, no tachypnea  NEURO: alert and oriented, CN grossly intact, moves upper extremities appropriately  SKIN: normal skin appearance  PSYCH: appropriate affect, intact thought and speech      Impression:   Exposure to influenza  Bronchiectasis with acute exacerbation (CMS-HCC)  He may have influenza A, versus RSV.  It is hard to tell, and the Stanford drive-through testing facility is closed yesterday and today.  I think, given his respiratory history with bronchiectasis and previous exacerbations, it would be reasonable to treat him presumptively with Tamiflu.  We also will have him start Symbicort 2 puffs twice daily until he is better.  He can continue to use the opiate medication he has at home for cough suppression at night; I did ask him to use half a tablet only per dose. He agrees.  He will let me know if his symptoms felt to improve or worsen.  He understands that if he has RSV and not influenza, he likely will not feel any better with the Tamiflu.    - oseltamivir (Tamiflu) 75 mg capsule; take 1 Capsule (75 mg total) by mouth 2 times a day for 5 days  Dispense: 10 Capsule; Refill: 0  - budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort) 160-4.5 mcg/actuation HFAA; 2 Puffs by Inhalation route 2 times a day  Dispense: 10.2 g; Refill: 1    "

It finally got better last week but came back. He hasnt been exercising much and he gave up on training for the Leedey  swim which he is really bummed about. He finds Bou very helpful. He has had GERD symptoms in the past but recently hasn't had much at all. His breathign feels okay.     He had a recurrent episode of kidney stones last week and he has an appointment with Dr. Clemow on 5/12 to review the findings and talk about a plan. He had a CT scan that shoed 1 6-mm stone and several smaller stones. He is currently planned for lithotrypsy 5/28. Going to Glade Spring  6/14. Worried about timing. He is on allopurinol for stone pro[hylaxis but isn't sure its helping. He has never taken HCTZ. Doesn't think he has ever had a 24-hour urine.

He underwent rhegmatogenous  retinal detachment repair on 06/05/2004. This consisted of scleral  buckle, cryotherapy, and drainage procedure. The retina remains attached  for 360 with a nice scleral buckling effect. He has a vitreous detachment.  He has mild cataracts in both eyes. He has had LASIK in both eyes.    Additionally, today for the first time he relates a history of a blowout  fracture of the left orbit involving the floor that was repaired 25 years  ago. He has no new symptoms today. He does have occasional flashing  lights and shimmering in the left eye, but no interval worsening. He  refused to have the right eye examined via dilation today, but what could  be seen was normal. He denies any symptomatology in the left eye.    At this time I have advised him of the signs and symptoms of retinal  detachment, including flashing lights, floating spots, curtain and/or  diminished visual acuity, and will have him follow up here with me in one  year, or sooner should he note any of those symptoms in either eye.

As you will recall he  is a 59-year-old gentleman recently diagnosed with a clinical stage T1C  prostate cancer, PSA 4.0, and biopsy Serbin grade 3 plus 4, present in 3  out of 12 cores, 2 on the left. His prostate was 31.6 cubic cm on  ultrasound. He has baseline nocturia once to twice per night and has  normal erections.    Past Medical History: Past medical history is significant for kidney  stones and a left shoulder and right knee replacement. He is currently  contemplating his options and we reviewed those for him today and believe  that he would be an excellent candidate for either surgery or  radiotherapy. Among the radiation options he is best suited for a course  of external beam using IMRT an image guided technique directed at the  prostate only and if so I would deliver that with four months of Androgen  suppression. He is less than an ideal candidate for brachytherapy given  the amount of grade 4 present in his biopsies. At this time the patient  will consider all of his options and call if he has more questions or  when he wants to initiate treatment. I believe the patient will do well  with either.    Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient.

We had him do two 24-hour urine collections which demonstrated elevated  urinary calcium, oxalate, as well as on one value, uric acid. In addition,  his total volume of urine was below 2 liters which would put him at  increased risk for stone formation. His blood values, however, were all  within the normal range. Of note is that his stone analysis came back  showing 90% calcium oxalate monohydrate, 10% calcium oxalate dihydrate.    Therefore, I discussed with him extensively the potential risk factors to  his stone formation and have referred to our dietician who will consult him  on reducing his dietary calcium to less 1,000 mg per day as well as  decrease the amount of uric acid and oxalate in his diet. I have also  encouraged him to drink upwards of 3 liters of clear fluid, preferably  water, per day.    I plan to see him back in 6 months' time for a KUB.

At this point, the tube is starting to extrude. It may still be patent to some degree as I don't see an effusion yet. It may be that the tube itself is causing a pressure sensation on the tympanic membrane.    For now, we discussed that in removing this tube now, it may cause a tear of the tympanic membrane. As the symptoms are subtle, patient wants to hold off. Will follow-up in a few weeks with Dr. Fabian. Perhaps tube can be removed at that time, and replaced with a new tube.

Osteopenia, as is evidenced by  DEXA T score of -1.6 at the right femoral neck.  Recent injuries not considered fragility fracture since velocity and speed were contributors.  No history of fragility fractures.  Bone health labs identified no secondary causes of bone loss or quality issues such as depletion mineralization.  Vitamin D was on the low end of normal at 39 NG per mL, however.  Contributing factors for this patient's bone loss include history of kidney stones, Kiefer with PPI use, history of prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy no ADT, and paternal family history of osteoporosis.     Pharmacologic Agents: Intervention with pharmacologic agents not indicated per bone density scan.  Patient has had an actual increase of bone density since 2010.  He states that he has retired since and has been more active.     Supplements: Vit D 2000IUs daily and Ca 600mg daily were recommended. I explained that these may be split into two doses in am and pm with food daily for best absorption.  Will adjust if indicated per lab results     Exercise: I explained to the patient that weightbearing exercises and resistance training is recommended to help to optimize bone re-formation and osteoblast activity.  Patient is extremely active.  I did discuss the difference between impact exercises and the Cody  versus swimming and the importance of increasing his impact exercise.  He states he will start walking daily.     Falls prevention: We discussed falls prevention efforts and the importance of assistive devices as needed for balance and stability.  We discussed appropriate footwear and in-home safety measures.  Not considered a fall risk.     Follow-up:  DEXA in 2 years.  Sooner if any new fractures.

As you are well aware, he is a very pleasant 68-year-old gentleman who is relatively healthy, who has had bilateral knee replacements and revisions, who, unfortunately, has recently been suffering from recurrent hemarthrosis on the left side.     Mr. Trainor reports that he had his left knee replaced back in 2008 after having an episode of spontaneous swelling. At that point, it was recommended that he undergo knee replacement due to degeneration of the joint. He reports that he recovered well from the surgery and had had no issues until recently. He reports that in March, he went to Fite with grandchildren and walked about 5 or 6 miles for several days. Following this, on 03/28/2024, he was watching television and had a spontaneous episode of swelling of the left knee, which was drained and demonstrated bloody drainage. He subsequently had similar episodes happen on 04/08/2024, on 04/15/2024 about a week later, and then the last episode was 05/02/2024. In May, he was seen at the emergency department at Sequoia Hospital, at which point they felt it best not to drain the knee to reduce risk of infection.     He denied any known precipitating factors as he has significantly cut down on his exercise regimen to try to prevent any further bleeding.     Of note, he has had multiple previous orthopedic surgeries including left shoulder replacement, right knee replacement and revision, and eye surgeries, and he has also had a robotic surgery for prostate cancer surgery back in 2010. Around this time, he had testing done for coagulopathy due to issues with bleeding after his robotic  prostate cancer surgery, which he reports were all normal.     His past medical history is relatively benign and includes high cholesterol, recurrent pneumonia with no recent episodes, and kidney stones. He currently takes allopurinol 300 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and a multivitamin daily.     His allergies include fentanyl and morphine.     His surgical history, as discussed above, includes left shoulder replacement, as well as bilateral knee replacements and revisions, as well as eye surgery. He also had robotic prostate cancer surgery in 2010 complicated by abdominal bleed requiring a reoperation and transfusion of at least 4-5 units of packed red blood cells.     Family history includes a father who died at age 85 with emphysema and CHF. His father also had an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was repaired. He also had a grandfather with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother died at age 91 after a 50-year history of multiple sclerosis.     On review of his social history, he is married for 47 years with 5 children and 12 grandchildren. He is a retired real estate developer and is a never smoker, does not drink alcohol, nor does he participate in recreational drug use.     His review of systems is otherwise negative, and he reports that he is otherwise a very active person who bikes, swims, and goes to the gym 3 days a week prior to the episodes of hemarthrosis.     On exam, his temperature is 36.4, heart rate 70 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/79. He has palpable upper extremity pulses. His abdomen has well-healed incisions and is soft, nontender, nondistended. There are no pulsatile masses. He has palpable femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. He has multiple knee incisions bilaterally, and on the left side, there is no significant swelling or tenderness to palpation or range of motion.     Vascular ultrasound was done today that demonstrates normal flow through  the popliteal artery on the left side with ABIs of 1.26 on the right and 1.13 on the left. There is evidence of a left knee fluid collection measuring 9 x 2 x 8 cm.     Overall, Mr. Trainor is a relatively healthy 68-year-old gentleman with episodes of recurrent left knee hemarthroses after a knee replacement back in 2008. It is unclear what precipitated this episode, but differentials for possible causes include arterial venous malformation, pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal branch, synovial inflammation, and unlikely but also potentially a tumor. We do see fluid behind the knee, however, there are no other masses visible. He is quite distressed by how the events have affected his life and would like to have answers as soon as possible. We believe it is sensible to proceed with a left lower extremity angiogram using provocative maneuvers to see if we can identify potential vascular causes of his bleeding episodes. We will schedule this as soon as possible, potentially as soon as this Thursday, and we will be in touch with our findings.     Thank you very much for referring Mr. Trainor to our Vascular Surgery Clinic, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions or concerns.

Four days ago he nicked the fourth knuckle on the left hand. Within   24 hours he had redness and swelling. He was seen locally and was   treated with Augmentin XR 2000 mg twice a day for 10 days and Septra DS   one b.i.d. for about 4 days. He was notified, apparently, that the   antibiotics were appropriate several days later and the organism was   identified as staph aureus. I do not know what the sensitivities   indicated. Soloway was particularly concerned because he has an artificial   joint. He has tolerated the antibiotics even at that high dose without   diarrhea or abdominal discomfort. He is current on tetanus in 2004.   His hand is substantially better.   2. Secondly, he has been diagnosed with Durrani 3 + 4 prostate cancer   and is considering various treatment options leaning toward surgery, and   at his age I would certainly concur with that inclination. He   understands potential complications of incontinence and impotence   associated with surgery. He and his wife are both here to discuss that,   and we had a lengthy discussion regarding the pros and cons of both   radiation and surgery and various surgeons.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Weight 201. Blood pressure 116/72. Pulse is 72 and regular. He has about  a centimeter and a half of resolving erythema over the fourth knuckle of  the left hand. The joint itself is not affected. He has good range of  motion without any discomfort. There is no lymphangitic streaking.    IMPRESSION:   1. Resolving cellulitis of the left hand.   2. CA of the prostate.    PLAN:  He will be following up at Stanford for his treatment of prostate cancer  and recheck with me as scheduled for annual exams and PRN in the meantime.              F.

As you recall, Mr. Kula is a 68M with multiple left knee surgeries who had persistent hemarthrosis.  He was taken to the angiography suite on 05/07/2017 for embolization of left popliteal AVM.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no issues.  Post-procedure, he continued to have some bleeding and need for drainage, however, he states that over the last month it has drastically improved.  He states the swelling to the knee has all resolved and he is significantly in less pain.          Patient  has a past medical history of Blood transfusion (2008); Cataract nuclear; Degenerative arthritis of knee; ED (erectile dysfunction); Fracture, orbit (1973); Hite (gastroesophageal reflux disease); Hypercholesterolemia; Kidney disorder; Kidney stones; Nephrolithiasis; Prostate cancer (CMS-HCC) (2008); Prostate cancer (CMS-HCC); Retinal tear (2004); and Shoulder joint replacement (2004).    Patient  has a past surgical history that includes radical prostatectomy (2008); laparotomy (2008); meniscectomy (1986); shoulder replacement (05/11/2004); patella open reduction internal fixation (1970); knee replacment (2006, 2008); other surgical history (06/11/2004); other surgical history (06/11/2004); other surgical history (1975); refractive surgery; colonoscopy (3/03); lithotripsy (5/14); knee total joint revision (Right, 09/09/2010); and VCL EXTERMITY LOWER Mangrum LEFT (Left, 05/07/2017).      Current Outpatient Prescriptions:   ¿  allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) 300 mg tablet  ¿  atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet  ¿  MULTIVITAMIN PO  ¿  zolpidem (AMBIEN) 10 mg tablet    The patient  reports that he has never smoked. He has never used smokeless tobacco. He reports that he does not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs.    Family  history is non-contributory.    On 14-point review of systems today, the patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, SOB, fevers or chills. Appetite is adequate. Energy is good. Denies nausea or vomiting. No abdominal or back pain. No diarrhea or constipation. No swelling. No skin rash. No bleeding or bruising. No headaches. No visual changes.  A full review of systems is otherwise negative.    Vital signs included   Visit Vitals   ¿ BP 120/69 (Patient site: Left Arm, Patient Position: Sitting)   ¿ Pulse 66   ¿ Temp 36.2 °C (97.2 °F) (Temporal)   ¿ Ht 1.829 m (6')   ¿ Wt 81.6 kg (180 lb)   ¿ BMI 24.41 kg/m2   .  On physical exam, the patient is comfortable, in no acute distress. Heart rate is regular.  Breathing is non-labored. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Extremities are warm with intact skin.  Vascular exam demonstrates palpable pedal pulses equal bilaterally.  No swelling appreciated at the knee.  No bruit appreciated.        Upon review of available imaging, arterial duplex  Patent left Popliteal Artery with no elevated velocities noted.  Phasic flow noted in left Popliteal Vein with normal response to augmentation.  No AVM seen in Popliteal fossa.  Multiphasic flow noted at the ankle with resting ABI's within normal limits, bilaterally.      In summary, Meredith G Clausen is a 68 Y male with a history of left popliteal AVM s/p coil embolization.  We discussed the findings on the ultrasound and that he has normal arterial and venous flow within the popliteal artery and vein.  There also no AVM appreciated on exam.  No further follow up is necessary in regards to the AVM as it appears to be treated appropriately.  We informed him to follow back up with Dr. Placencia and that he has no restrictions from a vascular standpoint with further orthopedic interventions.  He does not need follow up with Dr. Kirschner further, but should keep his 6month follow up with Dr. Amato in regards to his subclavian ectasia.           Many thanks for the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient. Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.

There were moderate degenerative changes noted  in the lumbar spine, which may give higher  than expected BMD  results.  L1 was eliminated from the BMD average of the spine  due to a known fracture.

Plan:  1. Osteopenia, as is evidenced by DEXA T score of -1.6 at the right femoral neck.  Recent injuries not considered fragility fracture since velocity and speed were contributors.  No history of fragility fractures.  Will obtain bone health labs to ensure no quality problems or depletion of mineralization. contributing factors for this patient's bone loss include history of kidney stones, Tentler with PPI use, history of prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy no ADT, and paternal family history of osteoporosis.    Pharmacologic Agents: Intervention with pharmacologic agents not indicated per bone density scan.  Patient has had an actual increase of bone density since 2010.  He states that he has retired since and has been more active.    Supplements: Vit D 2000IUs daily and Ca 600mg daily were recommended. I explained that these may be split into two doses in am and pm with food daily for best absorption.  Will adjust if indicated per lab results    Exercise: I explained to the patient that weightbearing exercises and resistance training is recommended to help to optimize bone re-formation and osteoblast activity.  Patient is extremely active.  I did discuss the difference between impact exercises and the Weston  versus swimming and the importance of increasing his impact exercise.  He states he will start walking daily.    Falls prevention: We discussed falls prevention efforts and the importance of assistive devices as needed for balance and stability.  We discussed appropriate footwear and in-home safety measures.  Not considered a fall risk.    Follow-up: 1 to 2 weeks to discuss bone health labs and any interventions that may be needed.     Spent 45 minutes face-to-face with patient today discussing the disease management of osteoporosis for the reduction of future fractures. I have explained the bone strength is equal to bone equality and density so a DXA scan is important to complement care. Over  half of the encounter time (50%) was spent counseling the patient on the disease osteoporosis, evidence based best practice treatment options available and recommendations for improved bone quality, importance of nutritional supplements for improved bone quality, falls prevention and personal safety for the reduction of future fractures. Clinician's guidelines to treatment for osteoporosis 2018 by the National Osteoporosis Foundation utilized are evidence based. Handouts were given to the patient for review on osteoporosis and other pharmacological treatment information related to other available treatment options for review.

He has been followed by Dr. Simon for this complaint since 06/11/2015. At that time, he did have a myringotomy performed. The effusion recurred, and the patient had a myringotomy with tube placement  in August. Patient thought he may be going on a scuba diving trip, and so had the tube removed in 04/11/2016. Patient never did go on that trip. Ear actually did quite well. Unfortunately once again in the last few weeks patient feels that the hearing on the left side is poor. Ear feels plugged. It feels virtually identical to the times he's had an effusion. However this time the patient did not have any antecedent upper respiratory infection. No allergy symptoms. No new snoring. No nasal obstruction. No headaches. No history of sinus problems.    Physical Exam:  The ears were examined microscopically. The right is normal. There is no wax, no debris, no retraction, no effusion. On the left, there is an amber effusion. The nose is clear anteriorly with no pus or purulence. The oral cavity shows normal lips, normal palate, normal buccal mucosa, normal tongue. The neck shows no adenopathy.      I reviewed great length with the patient the options. We discussed oral steroids. We discussed myringotomy alone. We discussed myringotomy and tube placement. Patient wishes to proceed with myringotomy alone. Informed consent was obtained.    DATE OF PROCEDURE: 09/24/2017 .    PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left serous otitis media.    POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same     PROCEDURE: Left myringotomy SURGEON: Guest Zimmet M.D.    FINDINGS: Under microscopic visualization the left ear was examined. The patient was found to have a serous effusion.  Tympanic membrane was anesthetized with phenol. Excellent anesthesia resulted. A myringotomy incision made in the anterior inferior tympanic membrane. Middle ear fluid was then aspirated with a #3 Frazier suction.  Patient noted immediate  improvement in hearing.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.     There are no complications.       Assessment & Plan  1. Eustachian tube dysfunction, left  I reviewed at great length with the patient this recurrent problem with eustachian tube dysfunction. The patient has a history of a traumatic injury to the left side of the face in college. We reviewed his former head CT. We discussed possible eustachian tube dysfunction related to this. We discussed the possible role of eustachian tube dilation due to the continued problem with recurrent serous otitis media. Referral placed to Stanford.  - REFERRAL TO ENT/OTOLARYNGOLOGY    2. Seromucinous otitis media, left  We discussed at great length expectations after myringotomy. We discussed possible tympanic membranes perforation due to the recurrent nature of these myringotomies. For now, strongly recommend recheck here 2 weeks to be sure wound is healing. Call anytime for drainage or other problems.  - INCISION OF EARDRUM    "

Rucker reports that he saw Dr. Parham a few days ago and they diagnosed with him an unstable right knee replacement and feel it needs to be operated on immediately, he is therefore scheduled for 3 days from now.  We reviewed his past complications after surgery:  1.  Bleeding after RP.  Workup and evaluation for this done over the last month and has been normal.  No evidence of bleeding issue.  2.  Pain control.  He had severe reactions to morphine and fentanyl.  He has done the best with dilaudid in the past.  3.  Nausea.  Possibly from the opioids, not sure, but last treated well with zofran.    From a cardiac perspective he is in excellent health, he did the Jackson  swim this last 06/16/2024 in just over an hour without symptoms.  He works out almost daily.  Please see my previous notes regarding his concern of Marfan's, which I don't think his history suggests.  He had an ultrasound showing normal abd aorta in 2008.

As you recall, Mr. Prioleau is a 68yoM former Stanford basketball player who has undergone re-do bilateral TKAs, the left of which was complicated by persistent hemarthrosis.  He was taken to the angiography suite on 05/07/2017 for embolization of left popliteal AVM.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no issues.  Post-procedure, he continued to have some bleeding and need for drainage, however, he states that it has completely resolved which is consistent with US performed at a previous clinic visit. Today the patient is here for followup of an abdominal duplex based on his family history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, as well as a cerebrovascular duplex study. The studies were completed today, and his abdominal study shows no true abdominal aortic or any iliac arterial aneurysms. He has no significant plaque as well. His carotid duplex study showed no evidence for any hemodynamically significant stenosis, but he does have some ectasia of the subclavian arteries bilaterally that is of no concern at this point in time.    Patient  has a past medical history of Blood transfusion (2008); Cataract nuclear; Degenerative arthritis of knee; ED (erectile dysfunction); Fracture, orbit (CMS-HCC) (1973); Nevin (gastroesophageal reflux disease); History of bacterial pneumonia (2015); Hypercholesterolemia; Kidney disorder; Kidney stones; Nephrolithiasis; Prostate cancer (CMS-HCC) (2008); Retinal tear (2004); and Shoulder joint replacement (2004). He also has no past medical history of DVT (deep venous thrombosis) (CMS-HCC); MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus); or Seizure disorder (CMS-HCC).    Patient  has a past surgical history that includes hx radical prostatectomy (2008); hx laparotomy (2008); hx  meniscectomy (1986); hx shoulder replacement (05/11/2004); patella open reduction internal fixation (1970); hx knee replacment (2006, 2008); hx refractive surgery; hx colonoscopy (3/03); hx lithotripsy (5/14); knee total joint revision (Right, 09/09/2010); VCL EXTERMITY LOWER Vakharia LEFT (Left, 05/07/2017); nasal fracture open reduction internal fixation; Eye scleral buckle (06/11/2004); orbital zygomatic fracture open reduction internal fixation (1975); wedge excision skin,nail fold(ingrown toenail) (06/11/2004); and knee total joint revision (Left, 07/27/2017).      Current Outpatient Prescriptions:   ¿  allopurinol (ZYLOPRIM) 300 mg tablet  ¿  atorvastatin (LIPITOR) 20 mg tablet  ¿  MULTIVITAMIN PO    The patient  reports that he has never smoked. He has never used smokeless tobacco. He reports that he does not drink alcohol or use drugs.    Family history is non-contributory.    On 14-point review of systems today, the patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, SOB, fevers or chills. Appetite is adequate. Energy is good. Denies nausea or vomiting. No abdominal or back pain. No diarrhea or constipation. No swelling. No skin rash. No bleeding or bruising. No headaches. No visual changes.  A full review of systems is otherwise negative.    Vital signs included   Visit Vitals  BP 129/87 (Patient site: Left Arm, Patient Position: Sitting)   Pulse 70   Temp 36.7 °C (98.1 °F) (Temporal)   Resp 16   Ht 1.854 m (6' 1"")   Wt 92.8 kg (204 lb 8 oz)   BMI 26.98 kg/m²   On physical exam, the patient is comfortable, in no acute distress. Heart rate is regular.  Breathing is non-labored. Abdomen is soft and nontender. Extremities are warm with intact skin. Vascular exam demonstrates palpable pedal pulses equal bilaterally. No swelling appreciated at the knee. No bruit appreciated.        12/08/2017: Carotid Duplex US  RIGHT: No hemodynamically significant ICA stenosis by velocity criteria. Smooth plaque in the internal carotid artery.  Tortuosity noted distally. Antegrade flow in the right vertebral artery. Normal flow in the right subclavian artery. Proximal subclavian ectatic artery measuring 1.5 x 1.6cm, stable compared to previous study of 06/09/2017.  LEFT: No hemodynamically significant ICA stenosis by velocity criteria. Smooth plaque in the internal carotid artery. Resistive flow in the left vertebral artery. Normal flow in the left subclavian artery. No significant change compared to the previous study of 06/09/2017.    In summary, Hindy G Prioleau is a 69 Y male with a history of left popliteal AVM s/p coil embolization as well as some subclavian ectasia noted previously on US and there is no evidence of progression of these ectatic segments into true aneurysms on surveillance imaging today. He should continue his ASA and statin as prescribed and follow up annually with cerebrovascular and abdominal ultrasounds.    Many thanks for the opportunity to participate in the care of this patient. Please do not hesitate to contact me with further questions.       Sincerely,         Turcott. MD, 12/08/2017, 2:55 PM  Vascular Surgery Fellow    I saw and examined the patient and discussed management with the resident.

ID Clinic Consultation    Referred by Glenn Pontious, Tavares Meier F*    Isiah G Niles is a 67 Y male whom I am asked to see in consultation for evaluation of possible cocci in gentleman with persistent infiltrates and non-diagnostic bronchoscopy.    Mr. Niles is a relatively healthy 67 year old man who, for the last 7 years or so, has been suffering from recurrent sinus infections that ""go into his lungs"".  He has had to take multiple courses of abx annually and possibly two prior pneumonias.   Although he took these antibiotics, he is skeptical that they provided benefit.  In November, while in Fall River , he developed a URI like illness that progressed over the course of the next few months.  He received augmentin courses x 2 as well as two courses of levofloxacin but symptoms persisted without change.  He said he had green purulent sputum.   He underwent CT, PFTs and bronchosopy at Stanford in February.    The CT showed ""basilar predominant tree-in-bud and nodular opacities, with airways thickening and mucus impaction, likely representing bronchocentric spread of infection/inflammation, such as from chronic aspiration and ""an area of consolidation in the left lower lobe with focal air lucency, considerations include a area of focal bronchiectasis versus a tiny cavity from focal necrotizing pneumonia. They also saw ""a ""cluster of bronchocentric nodules in the right upper lobe inferiorly and laterally with focal groundglass component measuring 10 mm, likely infectious"" .  There is also report of ""bulky hilar adenopathy"".  PFTs showed mild obstructive airway disease.  At that time, he was also worked up for CVID (immunoglobulins normal) and ABPA (nl IgE and no aspergillus precipitins).     BAL was uninformative with negative cultures for bacteria, AFB and fungi. Serology for histo and blasto were negative, but serology for cocci came back at 1:2.   Fortunately, however, over the month, symptoms markedly  improved with institution of aggressive airway cleaarnce maneuvers.  Subsequent chest CT showed improvement in all abnormalities and there was no further adenopathy.    Mr. Sunkin is now essentially asymptomatic.  He has returned to his very vigorous physical activity, swimming, working out at the gym, and continues to do his airway clearance.  He has had no fevers or chills, weight loss or diaphoresis.  Throughout his care, he has had no rashes, arthritis, diarrhea, N/V.    We are now asked whether the cocci of 1:2 likely represents Valley Fever that warrants rx.    Mr. Niles denies any recent visits to central valley.  When in Utah, there was snow on the ground; he was in Williamsport  area.  He has no family history of CF or other chronic pulmonary disease.

Recommend follow-up CT chest in   one year to assess for resolution and/or stability.        ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  Mr. Worden is a 67 year old man with recurrent rhinosinusitis over the last 7 years and several bouts of pneumonia, the last one of which was well documented.  Overall, however, he is quite healthy, doing vigorous exercise, working and enjoying life.  His symptoms seem to have markedly improved with pulmonary toilet.      We are asked to comment on the possibility of cocci.  I think this diagnosis is unlikely because a) he was not in ""cocci territory"" prior to onset of illness (there is cocci in Utah but not typically in the mountainous areas during snow season and not in Valentine /New Orleans ); b)  The titer was quite low and IgM was negative, c) it was not cultured on bronch despite pulmonary infiltrates.  However, the low positive cocci could be a cross-reaction with histo.  Mr. Niles has a great history of histo exposure (midwest farmer) and urine antigen may be negative for some manifestations of disease.  I have ordered serologies today.    Mr. Niles has had a good work up for other causes of recurrent sino-pumonary disease with normal immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses in 2015 and negative ABPA.  Although much less likely, I have ordered test for CGD.  Much further down the list  would be tests for CF and ciliary disease, neither of which I've ordered at this time.    Thank you for the opportunity to see this interesting patient.  Please let me know if I can assist further with his care.    "

He is a gentleman with a  history of kidney stones who has not been seen by us in almost three years.  He was last seen here in 2000 and had a 3 mm renal calculus. He has had no  recent GU evaluation and no recent GU problem. He urinates well and gets  up at the most once a night. He has had no stones since 2000. A PSA done  in May of last year was 2.42.    Rectal examination reveals a small, soft, symmetrical and non-nodular  prostate.    We drew a PSA and creatinine on the patient, and I have ordered a CT of his  abdomen and pelvis to evaluate any possibility of kidney stones.    The patient will be calling me back a week after his x-rays to check on the  results.

He presented to the Stanford emergency department, and a CT  scan showed that he had a 4 mm stone in his right UVJ area. He was given  IV pain medications and Phenergan. His symptoms were stable until about  three days ago when he began to have fevers to 102 . At that time he  submitted a urine sample which appeared sterile without hematuria.  However, he was started on Cipro in case of a urinary tract infection. He  passed a large stone on Saturday evening while at home. He began to feel  better, and on Sunday he was afebrile. He now states that his pain and  fevers are significantly better and he does not have any hematuria, dysuria  or fever.    He has a history of nephrolithiasis and has had intermittent episodes of  ""kidney stone attacks"" since 1982. He reports a previous stone analysis  showed calcium oxalate stones. He did bring a stone in for analysis today.  Mr. Pak also has an appointment with Dr. Mccabe in the next few weeks  and would like to keep this appointment to discuss various treatment  options with him.    CT scan dated 07/24/2024 shows a 4 mm right UVJ stone with mild  hydronephrosis. He also has a new 2 mm stone in his left kidney in the  lower pole. He has stable bilateral renal calculus with the largest  measuring 4 mm in the lower pole of his right kidney. Urinalysis on 07/25/2024 was negative.    Mr. Pak is a history of nephrolithiasis. I advised him to continue to  increase fluid intake, and we also reviewed diet to prevent further  formation of stones. I also asked him to consider a medication that might  help to decrease his  risk for forming no stones, but he would like to defer  treatment at this point and would rather wait until his appointment with  Dr. Harris and results of the stone analysis are complete. We will send  the stone for analysis today.    Sincerely yours,        Finnegan, N.P.

He has had a previous successful revision of his right knee by Dr Fontan. He elected to undergo a revision knee total knee arthroplasty to explore the knee and correct any operative errors. . The procedure including risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient at length. Informed consent was obtained.     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The correct patient was identified in the preoperative area where the correct surgical site was verified with the patient and marked. An adductor canal block was performed by anesthesia. The patient was then brought back to the operating suite and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was induced. A Ganem was  inserted. An upper thigh tourniquet was placed.The knee was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A time-out was performed. Antibiotics was given prior to esmarch exsanguination and tourniquet inflation. Tranexamic acid was held due to h/o thromboembolic events.    The preivous midline incision was utilized. Full thickness subcutaneous flaps were created. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was made. A thorough synovectomy was performed, excising scar tissues to aid in exposure. The quadriceps adhesions were release using a cobb. A medial release was performed. The knee was extended and a retropatellar debridement was done. The patella tendon was carefully protected throughout the entire case. The lateral patellofemoral ligament and the lateral retinaculum were released using Mayo scissors. The patella was retracted laterally. The knee was slowly flexed up. The distal femur was skeletonized medially and laterally. The polyethylene liner was removed with an osteotome. The femoral component was flexed and laterally translated, and in good rotation.  However, there was gross impingement of the lateralized component both on the synovium and the quadriceps tendon.  The synovium was black.  The femoral component was further exposed and the cement bone interface was separated using an osteotome.  A Gigli saw was used to separate the interface proximally.   The femoral component was then disimpacted carefully with a tamp. There was minimal bone loss. The femoral canal was reamed sequentially up to a size 15 reamer. The distal metaphysis was reamed to an 18. The femur was sized to be an F, consistent with preoperative template. The anterior, distal and posterior cut surfaces were freshened up with a saw, to ensure they are parallel with the epicondylar axis. It was trialed with 10mm distal augments and had an excellent fit. The trial was removed and the tibia was subluxed anteriorly.    The cement bone interface  on the tibia was separated using osteotomes and saw. The tibial component was disimpacted and a tamp. There was minimal bone loss. The cement was removed with osteotomes while preserving bone. The tibial canal was reamed sequentially to a 13mm stem. The tibial cut was freshened with the cutting guide. The cut was checked with a drop rod. The tibia was sized to be a 6, consistent with preoperative template. The tibia was prepared. Tibial trial with 10mm augments were placed, and the femoral trial was placed which fit nicely. The knee was taken through full ROM and had stable flexion and extension gap.     The patella was then everted with the knee in full extension. Scar was excised circumferentially. A full lateral release was performed and was extended proximally with a cobb. Excess bone overgrowth was removed. The patella button now can be brought over medially. The knee was taken through ROM and the patella tracked nicely at this point.     All trials were removed. The bony surfaces were thoroughly irrigated and dried. Cement was mixed. Implants were verified with OR staff and assembled on the back table by the operating surgeon. The implants were cemented into place and the trial poly was inserted. Cement was allowed to set with the knee in fixed full extension. Excess cement was removed. The final poly was inserted. The knee was once again taken through ROM and had excellent stability.     80cc of 0.2% ropivicaine with epineprhine and toradol was into the capsule. The tourniquet was released and hemostasis achieved. A drain was placed exiting superolaterally. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. The arthrotomy was closed using #1 Vicryl in figure-of-eight fashion. Subcutaneous tissue was closed using 2-0 Vicryl, and skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a ski box were applied. The patient was then awoken from anesthesia and taken to the PACU in stable condition.     Postoperatively, the patient will  be admitted to the orthopedic service for observation, pain control, evaluation and treatment by PT/OT, DVT prophylaxis. XR will be taken in PACU.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Failed right total knee replacement with dislodgement of the tibial insert and posterior subluxation.     POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Failed right total knee replacement with dislodgement of the tibial insert and posterior subluxation.     OPERATION PERFORMED:   1. Revision right total knee replacement.   2. Synovectomy.   3. Lengthening of iliotibial band.     COMPLICATIONS: None.     ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 200 mL.     CLINICAL HISTORY: This is a 62-year-old active male who has had a right total knee with revision. Unfortunately, his knee continued to swell and be painful as well as unstable. He continued to ambulate on his right knee despite the tibial component subsiding anteriorly and the stem of the base plate being posteriorly adjacent to the cortex. The insert made out of polyethylene had extruded, and the tibia was subluxated posteriorly. Clearly this situation was untenable.     A revision total knee replacement was done today. All the pros, cons, possible complications, blood requirements, and other matters were explained to the patient in detail prior to informed consent.     PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The case was done in a laminar flow room and the surgeons wore body exhaust suits.     The patient was given a femoral nerve block in the preoperative area. Antibiotics were held until the tourniquet was released and all components were in place to get appropriate cultures.     The patient was given a general anesthetic in room 18 at Memphis , and then the urinary catheter was placed.     A tourniquet was placed high in the thigh and the leg prepped and draped sterilely as per our routine.     All pressure points were padded.     The tourniquet was elevated to 300 mmHg  after exsanguination of the limb.    The old central incision was first used. The central incision actually measured 8 cm in length and this was extended both proximally and distally for quite some length. Tissue flaps were raised and the medical parapatellar arthrotomy was performed. We had previously aspirated the knee and sent it for culture. At least 6 other cultures were taken throughout the case of the synovium, the tibia, and the femur. There did not look to be any infection present.     There was a florid synovitis and so a synovectomy was performed with the cautery. The medial collateral ligament was released off bone. The soft tissue all around the patella was excised.     It was immediately visible that the insert made out of polyethylene had extruded out from the tibial component. This was extracted.     Further synovectomy was performed.     The femoral component was then excised with osteotomes and Gigli saw, saving as much bone as possible. Cultures were taken all around the femur including the medullary canal.     We first prepared the femur with the Zimmer LCCK intramedullary components on the femoral side. We reamed by hand up to an including a size 16 mm diameter. We used the intramedullary guides to then resect minimally anteriorly as the femur was already notched. We used the six degree distal cutter to freshen up the ends of the bone. We sized the femur and a size E seemed appropriate. We then used the appropriate blocks to finish the anterior and posterior cuts. We placed the size E CCK femoral component trial with 5 mm augments distally and 5 mm augments posteriorly, and determined that we needed a 10 mm augment laterally with 5 mm everywhere else. We used a size 16 x 155 mm extension rod and this centralized and stabilized the femoral component and the fit was very good. The box cut was eventually made for the CCK component.     We sized all trials femoral components and protected the distal  femur. We had previously taken out the tibial insert and then directed our attention to the tibial baseplate. This had plunged anteriorly such that it had a reverse slope. It was loose in extracted. The cement bone interface was by in large loose as well as it had sunken in anteriorly. We used osteotomes, mallets, and various different instruments to excise all the other cement. The bone on the anterior one-third of the tibia was extremely soft and deficient in areas because the tibial component had gone into the anterior aspect of the tibia, sloping it in reverse fashion. Furthermore, the tibial component was internally rotated perhaps 10 or 15 degrees.     Therefore, we did a synovectomy all around the tibia and placed appropriate Negrin retractors to expose the tibia, and then began hand reaming up to and including a size 13 x 155 straight reamer. We then used the size 6 tibial base plate which we placed in the correct amount of rotation such that a long guide rod went to the center of the ankle joint. We pinned this and made our stem and our flange cuts. We then added 5 mm thickness blocks on the tibia and assembled the trial tibial component, size 6 tibia with a 13 x 155 mm extension and 5 mm blocks medially and laterally. We trialed again with the CCK femoral side and a size 12 mm CCK insert gave good, snug, fitting with an excellent range.     All trial components were excised. We mixed 3 packages of polymethyl-methacrylate in the vacuum mixing device, and then applied this to the tibial and femoral components on the proximal half to just go past the junction with the long stem. We had previously irrigated, cleaned, and scraped the tibia and femur as well as excised any loose fragments of cement or bone. We bone grafted anteriorly on the tibia with some of the recycled bone cuts.     We placed the tibial component in first after cleaning and drying and assembling all the components. We then put the femoral  component in cemented as above once the femoral side was irrigated, cleaned, and dried. Excess bone cement was taken from the area. We held the insert in place until the cement had dried.     We had previously examined the patellar component which was an anatomical rather than a spherical one. There was minimal wear and it tracked satisfactorily and, because there was not a great deal of bone behind the component, we decided to leave in in situ. Some excess bone cement was debrided and a synovectomy was performed around the patella as well. It tracked well on trailing as well.     After all the components were cemented in, we released the tourniquet and took off any excess bone cement and irrigated copiously. All the bleeders were cauterized. We eventually exposed the tibia even further and snap fit a size 12 mm LCCK insert in place and used the locking screw to engage and lock the insert to the stem. The torque wrench was used and the tibia stabilized with the appropriate U tool.     We reduced the knee and the range of motion was excellent as was the stability. We irrigated and debrided and then cauterized any bleeders. We placed a reinfusion drain superolaterally and then connected it to the lateral gutter of the knee. We then closed the arthrotomy with figure-of-eight #1 Dexon sutures insuring a water tight closure. We closed the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 Dexon and the skin with stainless steel staples. A compression dressing was then applied.     The patient was then awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition.     The total tourniquet time was approximately 100 minutes.     I should mention that the patient had a nonsterile SCD and TED stocking on the contralateral leg throughout the case. When the tourniquet was released 2 g of Honolulu  was given intravenously.     Our plan for this patient is to mobilize him weightbearing as tolerated with a walker and then crutches. We will look at  the wound in a few days and begin CPM as long as the wound looks good.

Popliteal artery angiogram demonstrates multiple genicular collaterals around the patient's posterior knee with a prominent AV malformation of the knee joint posteriorly.  4. Successful embolization of main genicular branch feeding avium.    INDICATIONS: Mr. Turk is a 68-year-old  relatively healthy gentleman who is status post left knee replacement back in 2008 which he had been doing well from except recently he has developed multiple episodes of left knee hemarthrosis requiring drainage. X-rays did not show any distinct abnormalities and thus he was referred to the vascular surgery clinic for further evaluation. Ultrasound demonstrated good flow through the popliteal artery with residual fluid in the posterior knee. It was thus recommended he undergo left lower extremity angiogram to identify any potential sources of his recurrent bleeding and possible treatment with coil embolization of any culprit branches or AVMs. After discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure the patient agreed to proceed.    PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the cath lab and laid supine on the operative table. He was attached to all appropriate monitors. The bilateral groins were prepped and draped in the usual surgical fashion. Time-out was called to identify the correct patient, the correct site, and the correct procedure and all were in agreement. He was given IV sedation.     Using ultrasound guidance and after using local for numbing, a microneedle was inserted into the common femoral artery and was exchanged for a microcatheter over a microwire. Angiogram demonstrated puncture within the proximal common femoral artery. The MicroSheath was exchanged for a 5-French sheath over a Ho wire and using the Ghobrial wire to go up we found that the right iliac artery system appears to be very tortuous. We then used an Omni catheter and a Glidewire to cross the bifurcation which again demonstrated a very torturous left iliac system. We were fortunately able to get the Glidewire all the way down into the SFA and parked it here over which we were able to track a Glide catheter across into the proximal SFA but, however, it would not track any further without outflow looping. We  then removed the Poolville  and tried to place a Vijayakumar which caused the catheter to kick back. We then tried to use a stiff Glidewire which again kicked the catheter out of the bifurcation. We thus went back up with our Omni and tried to use a Glide Advantage wire to cross the bifurcation but this proved to be difficult as well. We were eventually able to cross the bifurcation with the Glidewire. That was parked deep in the SFA. However, no other catheters would track over so we used the Quick Cross catheter to get more purchase in the SFA; however, it would not track past the external iliac artery. We left the Quick Cross here and used a stiff Piedmont  and we were finally able to get down into the SFA with our stiff Glide. The patient had been given 5000 units of heparin with the entry of the 5-French sheath and he was given additional intravenous heparin to maintain ACT greater than 200.     We then exchanged our 5-French for a 90 cm 6-French Destination sheath which was parked within the distal SFA. We then obtained magnified views around the knee and found that there was a large genicular branch with side branches that were likely feeding what appeared to be an arterial venous malformation. We thus elected to use a 100 cm vert to navigate down to the popliteal artery and using the vertebral catheter and a Glidewire we were able to cannulate the genicular branch. We obtained angiograms that demonstrated that the AVM appeared to be coming from a branch of this geniculate artery and thus we then used a Progreat Coaxial Microcatheter System. We were then able to cannulate the branch after which we placed a 2 mm x 2 cm AZUR CX coil. The coil appeared to be in good position after angiogram and there was a significant reduction in the filling of the AVM. We then obtained another angiogram which seemed to demonstrate that the AVM was also being fed by a distal geniculate artery and thus tried to reposition the patient  to get the best imaging of this area. We then tried to cannulate the lower genicular branch with the Progreat Microcatheter System and its wire and then a double curved 0.018 glidewire. However, the patient was unable to hold the same position for very long and thus we went back to the frog-leg position to try to cannulate the branch from this position. This proved to be very difficult and after another proximal and distal angiogram it actually appeared that the AVM was still persistently filling from another branch of the initial geniculate artery we had cannulated and coiled. We thus elected to try to recannulate this branch which we were able to do with the vertebral catheter and Progreat microcatheter. We then tried to get into a lower branch that appeared to be feeding the AVM but this proved to be very difficult given the tortuosity of the branch artery. We thus elected to coil the entirety of the artery up to its ostium. We then placed multiple 3 mm x 8 cm coils followed by a 3 mm x 4 cm coil proximally. Repeat angiogram demonstrated occlusion of this artery without filling of the AVM any further and continued filling of the popliteal artery without coil luminal intrusion.     At this point, we removed all catheters and wires and exchanged the wire for the Glide Advantage and removed our sheath in a controlled fashion. The arteriotomy was then closed with a Perclose device with good result. However, there was some mild oozing for which an additional 10 minutes of manual pressure provided hemostasis. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to PACU in stable condition.     Dr. Ethel Greear was present and participated throughout the case.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Grade 1 open right transverse olecranon fracture.    OPERATION PERFORMED:   1. Irrigation and debridement of open olecranon fracture including skin and fat  2. Open reduction and internal fixation right olecranon fracture.    SURGEON: Kadiri Potti Pickens, MD    ASSISTANTS: Kenyon Estes, MD and Konner Pruthi, MD.    ANESTHESIA: General.    COMPLICATIONS: None.    IMPLANTS: Synthes proximal olecranon plate.    INDICATIONS: This is a 72-year-old male who sustained a mechanical fall on 09/20/2024, and landed on his right elbow. He sustained a small grade 1 open olecranon fracture. He was admitted and started on IV antibiotics. He was indicated for irrigation and debridement and open reduction and internal fixation of the injury. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient. Specifically, risks including bleeding, neurovascular injury, infection, loss of reduction and implant failure, as well as stiffness and loss of range of motion, failure to heal, and need for further surgery, and finally the potential for prominent hardware and symptomatic hardware were discussed with the patient. All questions were answered, informed consent was obtained, and he agreed to proceed with the procedure.    PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and general anesthesia was induced. He was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. All bony prominences were well-padded. The surgical site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A sterile tourniquet was applied. A posterior incision was made along the olecranon and subcutaneous border of the ulna, and this was carried down through the olecranon bursa, and to the subcutaneous border of the ulna. The fracture site was identified. The periosteum was excised from the fracture edges. There was not  any sign of frank contamination, although there was a fair amount of periosteal stripping along the fracture surface. The fracture was debrided of hematoma, and the joint was inspected through the fracture site. There was no intraarticular debris. The fracture site was thoroughly cleaned and irrigated with 3 liters of saline. At this point, a midline split in the triceps insertion was made to accommodate the plate. The triceps was sutured in Delta  fashion with a #2 FiberWire to allow tension band fixation of the proximal fragment through the plate, which would be tied down at the end of the procedure. The fracture was then reduced using a straight-curve clamp and 2 crossed K-wires to hold provisional reduction. Reduction was confirmed to be anatomic with fluoroscopy. The plate was provisionally secured with a 3.5 screw in the subcutaneous border of the ulna, and then compressed proximally with a 2.7 lag screw, which was inserted by technique. At this point, again, fluoroscopy was obtained and demonstrated anatomic reduction with adequate compression of the fracture site. We then chose to finalize fixation with 2.7 locking screws proximally and one more 3.5 cortical screw distally. Final images were obtained and demonstrated maintenance of reduction and appropriate implant position as well as full flexion and extension. At this point, the #2 FiberWire that had been placed through the triceps was tied down over the plate. The wound was irrigated, vancomycin powder was applied over the plate, and the wound was closed in a layered fashion using nylon sutures for skin. The patient was awoken from anesthesia and was in a stable condition. He was transferred to the recovery room.    POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:   1. Patient will have a 3-pound weightbearing limit on the right upper extremity.  2. Complete 24-hours of Spring Valley .  3. He was placed in a posterior slab, which will be removed in 2 weeks to allow for active range of  motion.

After failure of conservative management, the patient elected to proceed with total hip arthroplasty. The risks, benefits, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed in detail with the patient, who understood. All questions were answered. Informed consent was obtained.      PROCEDURE IN DETAILS: The patient was identified in the preop holding area. Surgical site was verified with the patient and marked. The patient was then transferred to the operating room. Anesthesia was performed by the anesthesia team. The patient was placed in the lateral decubitus position. An axillary roll was placed. All bony prominences were well padded. The operative lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A team time-out was performed. Prophylactic antibiotics and tranexamic acid were given prior to incision.      An anterolateral approach was made, centered over the greater trochanter. Hemostasis was obtained. The fascia lata was incised at its midline and extended proximally and distally with Ambroson scissors. A Charnley retractor was placed exposing the abductors and vastus lateralis. A tag stitch was placed anteriorly. Sharp  Hohmanns were placed between the anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3 junction proximally and distally. An anterior abductors sleeve was subperiosteally elevated in a curvilinear fashion between the Hohmanns, along with a thin wafer of bone. Extracapsular release was performed with Mayos. Multiple Hohmanns were placed about the femoral head. An anterior capsulectomy was performed. The patient's hip was dislocated anteriorly and the extremity was placed in the sterile bag.     The neck cut was made in line with the preoperative template in reference to the lesser trochanter at 12mm. Charnley awl was inserted intramedullary followed by the lateralizing reamer. Sequential broaching was then done up to a size 12.5, with good cortical fit proximally, while taking care to dial in the appropriate anteversion. The broach was then removed.    The acetabulum was exposed with appropriate retractors. Periacetabular soft tissue was removed to exposed the rim. The pulvinar was curretted. The acetabulum was sequentially reamed to 61mm for a 62mm cup. Good cancellous bone and coverage were obained. The cup was impacted into place, with attention to anteversion and abduction. Two 6.5 x 30mm screws were placed in the safe zone with good purchase. The position of the cup was once again checked. The necessary osteophytes were trimmed. A highly cross-link polyethylene liner was inserted with the locking mechanism engaged.      The femur was again exposed, and the broach reinserted. Trialing was performed and the hip reduced easily and was stable to all ranges of motion. Excellent stability was achieved anteriorly and posteriorly. Leg lengths were verified to be clinically equal. The hip was dislocated and the trial components were removed. The final stem was inserted. Vital was cleaned and dried. The final head 36mm was impacted. The hip was reduced and stability was once again verified.      The wound was thoroughly irrigated and no drain  was placed. The abductors sleeve was repaired through bone tunnels with #2 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight fashion. The fascia lata was closed using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight fashion. Subcutaneous tissue was closed using 2-0 Vicryl and skin was stapled. Sterile dressing and abduction pillow were applied. All sponge and needle counts were correct at end the case.      The patient awoke from anesthesia without complication and was transported to the PACU postoperatively.     The patient will be admitted postoperatively for observation, pain control, PT/OT, DVT prophylaxis, post-op antibiotics. XR will be taken in PACU.    POSTOPERATIVE PLAN:   1.   Admit to the ward.  2.   Post-operative antibiotics.  3.   Aspirin 81mg BID, DVT prophylaxis.  4.   Weightbearing as tolerated with PHP  5.

Stool softeners (colace), fiber (fruits, vegetables, bran) and extra fluid intake can help.    DO NOT take NSAIDs like ibuprofen (motrin, advil), naproxen (naprosyn, aleve) for 4-6 weeks after surgery    To prevent tylenol overdose, do not take acetaminophen (tylenol) at the same time as a combination narcotic medication that contains tylenol, such as norco, lortab, vicodin, or percocet.

His multiple orthopedic injuries include left shoulder replacement, right knee replacement and revision, and complications related to his left knee replacement. He had his left knee replaced in 2008 after having an episode of spontaneous swelling. At that point, it was recommended that he undergo knee replacement due to degeneration of the joint. He reports that he recovered well from the surgery and had had no issues until recently. He reports that in March, he went to Goldring with grandchildren and walked about 5 or 6  miles for several days. Following this, on 03/28/2024, he was watching television and had a spontaneous episode of swelling of the left knee, which was drained and demonstrated bloody drainage. He subsequently had similar episodes happen on 04/08/2024, on 04/15/2024 about a week later, and then the last episode was 05/02/2024. In May, he was seen at the emergency department at Sequoia Hospital, at which point they felt it best not to drain the knee to reduce risk of infection. He was referred to Dr. Vallee for evaluation of recurrent left knee hemarthrosis with ultrasound demonstrating normal ABI's with normal flow throughout the popliteal artery, and a left knee fluid collection measuring 9x2x8cm.      Based on Dr. Templin's assessment, it is unclear what precipitates the hemarthrosis, but differentials for possible causes include arterial venous malformation, pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal branch, synovial inflammation, and unlikely but also potentially a tumor. He is quite distressed by how the events have affected his life and would like to have answers as soon as possible. Dr. Walls believes it is sensible to proceed with a left lower extremity angiogram using provocative maneuvers to see if she can identify potential vascular causes of his bleeding episodes. He is here today for left lower extremity angiogram, possible angioplasty and stent.     Hospital Course/Significant Findings:   Patient was taken to cath lab and found to have an AVM that was fed by two genicular arteries- which was treated by coil embolization.  He was transferred to the CAPR short stay unit in stable condition.  He continued to have palpable pedal pulses post operatively.  At the time of discharge POD1, pt was tolerating a PO diet, requiring PO pain meds, able to void on own and able to ambulate on his own. He was instructed on wound care and follow up appointments by our chief resident.

Please do not soak or submerge your incision in water, a hot tub, or pool for at least 4 weeks.     When  To Resume Daily Activities   Order Comments: We can't certify or tell patients when they can drive. However, when you are full weightbearing on your driving leg, able to brake suddenly, maneuver your car safely, and are not on any narcotics or medications that make you drowsy or alters your mental status, then you should be able to drive.     Order Specific Question Answer Comments   Driving Other (see comment)      Additional Instructions   Order Comments: You should walk a few times a day even if it is only inside your house. It is important to maintain circulation in your legs to prevent blood clots from forming, which can cause swelling, difficulties breathing, and are very dangerous and require immediate medical attention. If you notice that your feet or ankles get slightly swollen on both sides, this may be normal after surgery. Elevating your feet at rest on pillows can be helpful to decrease swelling in legs. If, however, you notice that only one leg is swollen, call us right away as this may indicate a problem with your circulation that may need medical attention. If there are any concerns about leg swelling, please call us.     You can use MyHealth to manage your prescriptions, make appointments, and communicate with your care team. To access your records and securely communicate with your care team, visit myhealth.stanfordhealthcare.org and use the access code provided in your After Visit Summary to activate your account. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your incision or wound such as swelling, redness, or drainage, please use MyHealth to send a picture of it.    For any refills of your medications prescribed by the Orthopedic team, please notify your healthcare team at least 3 days in advance to process your request and prevent delays.    Postoperative Pain:  It is normal to have post-operative pain. Prescription pain medications are meant to reduce but not eliminate post-operative pain.  Our goal is to reduce your pain to a tolerable level so you can return to your activities of daily living quickly. Prescribed pain medications such as Oxycodone, San Bernardino , Dilaudid, Vicodin, Tylenol #3 and Percocet are to be taken as needed. This means that these medications should only be taken while you feel pain or discomfort in order to assist in controlling the post-operative pain. We recommend taking Tylenol scheduled around the clock as it is most effective when taken this way and it will reduce the amount of prescribed opioid medication needed to control pain. If you have a healthy liver it is safe to take up to 4 grams of Tylenol per day. If you have a history of liver disease, it is safe for you to take up to 2 grams of Tylenol per day. For certain procedures in which an anesthetic block was provided, we encourage starting the use of prescription   pain medication prior to feeling pain symptoms to avoid having severe pain after the block wears off. Once you are back to doing your activities of daily living we expect that you will be able to reduce the amount of prescribed pain medications you are taking until you are only taking Tylenol. Other methods that have been shown to reduce post-operative pain include using ice packs and elevating the surgical site. Elevating the surgical site as much as possible is an effective way to reduce swelling and pain. Ideally the surgical site can be elevated above the level of the heart to minimize swelling and pain. This can be helpful in reducing pain for several weeks post-operatively.    NSAIDs:  NSAIDs such as ibuprofen/motrin, alleve/naproxen, celebrex/celecoxib, meloxicam/mobic are controversial and may impair fracture healing when taken long-term. You may have received these medications in the hospital but we recommend against taking them for post-operative pain now that you are being discharged. You should avoid these medications for at least 4 weeks after  surgery.    Safety Recommendations:  You should avoid driving, operating machinery, or drinking alcohol while taking prescribed pain medications as these medications may cause drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, and other impairment of physical and mental abilities.    Disposal Recommendations:  We recommend that you remove expired, unwanted, or unused medicines from your home as quickly as possible to help reduce the chance that others may accidentally take or intentionally misuse them.   Prescription pain medications (including hydrocodone, Vicodin, Hesperia , oxycodone, Percocet, codeine, Tylenol #3, hydromorphone, Dilaudid) can be safely and securely disposed of in a drop box in the lobby of the Palo Alto Police Department at 877 794th Ave, Spring Valley WI .    You can also dispose of medications at these locations:   Regional Water Quality Control Plant, 2501 Marksville  (at the pharmacy counter), 300 University Avenue  Palo Alto Medical Foundation (at the pharmacy counter), 795 El Camino Real  If you are unable to bring unused prescription pain medications to a local drop box, you may flush them down the toilet, as recommended by the U.S Food & Drug Administration (FDA).

As you know, he is a pleasant 71-year-old here for followup of an emergency room visit, where he had an acute T10 superior endplate fracture and an L1 burst fracture after a tree limb had fallen on his back 20 feet away. He also has right 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th rib fractures. We recommended conservative treatment in a TLSO brace. He has been somewhat noncompliant with the TLSO brace, although he has not been doing very much due to the shelter in place. Overall, he is able to do all of his life activities. He has avoided lifting. He feels his back pain is getting better every day. He has been very conscious of his posture, as he has been working with this in Pilates in the past. He feels it is more of low back strain. He takes oxycodone 5 mg every 4 hours and has a tapering schedule himself in terms of pain management, as he has had multiple other orthopedic surgeries and understands pain management. He denies any radicular symptoms.    Past Medical History: Prostate cancer, kidney stones.    Past Surgical History: Rhinoplasty, left shoulder replacement, right and left knee replacement twice each, suborbital blowout fracture, skull fracture.    Medications:   1. Lipitor 40 mg.   2. Oxycodone 5 mg q.4 hours.    Allergies: No known drug allergies.    Family History: Reviewed and noncontributory.    Social History: He denies tobacco smoking, alcohol use. Lives at home with his wife. He is retired.    Review Of Systems: Positive for symptoms as stated above in history of present illness; otherwise, remainder of review of systems is negative. No bowel or bladder dysfunction, no radicular symptoms.    Physical Examination: VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 118/67, temperature 98.3, height 6  feet 1 inch, 200 pounds, pulse 80, pain is 8/10. Overall, good coronal and sagittal balance. Normal gait. He has no significant tenderness midline to palpation and percussion, but more right side T7-10th ribs on the right side. Straight leg test negative bilaterally. Hip flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, EHLs intact. Sensation intact to light touch in bilateral lower extremities.    Imaging: X-rays and CT scan done when he was in the emergency room visit demonstrate chronic midthoracic spine wedging with overall Scheuermann's kyphosis, and again more acute burst fracture at L1 and mild endplate fracture at T10. Overall, the alignment at T12 to L2 is good. Right T7-10 rib fractures.    Assessment: 71-year-old male who is 12 days status post a tree limb falling on his back, with an L1 burst fracture and a milder T10 superior endplate fracture with 4 rib fractures. Overall, doing relatively well with improvement in his back pain every day, treated conservatively. He has good overall coronal and sagittal balance.    Plan: He is reassured that these fractures will heal in 6 weeks. He should avoid flexion and hunching, and work on his posture so he can heal more in an acceptable alignment. He will also start to do some wall sits and overall avoid lifting 10 to 15 pounds. He should not be road bicycling and we do not recommend any physical therapy at this time. It is okay for him to do regular swimming, but no flip turns. He had multiple questions answered to his satisfaction. Again, taper down his pain medication and he is working with primary care doctor for this. I would like to see him back in about a month to get final x-rays and we only need a lateral scoliosis xray. He is comfortable with this plan.      Carter Amin, PA-C  I, Zigmund Gheorghiu, saw and examined the patient with the physician's assistant, performed a physical exam and obtained a history, review of systems, and formulated and  discussed a plan with the patient during face to face interaction with the patient.  I agree with the note as documented above.  As above; healing well in good alignment after multiple fractures.  He will f/u with me in about 6 weeks, and continue to be careful about his posture and avoid activities as noted above  Noori Kaura, MD  Professor  Orthopaedic Surgery  Noori Kaura, MD        D:  05/29/2020   T:  05/29/2020    / MODL  SJN: [000000]   DJN: [000000]     Clinical Area Code:  132    "

As you are well aware, he is a very pleasant 68-year-old gentleman who is relatively healthy, who has had bilateral knee replacements and revisions, who, unfortunately, has recently been suffering from recurrent hemarthrosis on the left side.     Mr. Temple reports that he had his left knee replaced back in 2008 after having an episode of spontaneous swelling. At that point, it was recommended that he undergo knee replacement due to degeneration of the joint. He reports that he recovered well from the surgery and had had no issues until recently. He reports that in March, he went to Khamis with grandchildren and walked about 5 or 6 miles for several days. Following this, on 03/28/2024, he was watching television and had a spontaneous episode of swelling of the left knee, which was drained and demonstrated bloody drainage. He subsequently had similar episodes happen on 04/08/2024, on 04/15/2024 about a week later, and then the last episode was 05/02/2024. In May, he was seen at the emergency department at Sequoia Hospital, at which point they felt it best not to drain the knee to reduce risk of infection.     He denied any known precipitating factors as he has significantly cut down on his exercise regimen to try to prevent any further bleeding.     Of note, he has had multiple previous orthopedic surgeries including left shoulder replacement, right knee replacement and revision, and eye surgeries, and he has also had a robotic surgery for prostate cancer surgery back in 2010. Around this time, he had testing done for coagulopathy due to issues with bleeding after his robotic  prostate cancer surgery, which he reports were all normal.     His past medical history is relatively benign and includes high cholesterol, recurrent pneumonia with no recent episodes, and kidney stones. He currently takes allopurinol 300 mg daily, Lipitor 20 mg daily, and a multivitamin daily.     His allergies include fentanyl and morphine.     His surgical history, as discussed above, includes left shoulder replacement, as well as bilateral knee replacements and revisions, as well as eye surgery. He also had robotic prostate cancer surgery in 2010 complicated by abdominal bleed requiring a reoperation and transfusion of at least 4-5 units of packed red blood cells.     Family history includes a father who died at age 85 with emphysema and CHF. His father also had an abdominal aortic aneurysm that was repaired. He also had a grandfather with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. His mother died at age 91 after a 50-year history of multiple sclerosis.     On review of his social history, he is married for 47 years with 5 children and 12 grandchildren. He is a retired real estate developer and is a never smoker, does not drink alcohol, nor does he participate in recreational drug use.     His review of systems is otherwise negative, and he reports that he is otherwise a very active person who bikes, swims, and goes to the gym 3 days a week prior to the episodes of hemarthrosis.     On exam, his temperature is 36.4, heart rate 70 beats per minute, blood pressure 125/79. He has palpable upper extremity pulses. His abdomen has well-healed incisions and is soft, nontender, nondistended. There are no pulsatile masses. He has palpable femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally. He has multiple knee incisions bilaterally, and on the left side, there is no significant swelling or tenderness to palpation or range of motion.     Vascular ultrasound was done today that demonstrates normal flow through  the popliteal artery on the left side with ABIs of 1.26 on the right and 1.13 on the left. There is evidence of a left knee fluid collection measuring 9 x 2 x 8 cm.     Overall, Mr. Regan is a relatively healthy 68-year-old gentleman with episodes of recurrent left knee hemarthroses after a knee replacement back in 2008. It is unclear what precipitated this episode, but differentials for possible causes include arterial venous malformation, pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal branch, synovial inflammation, and unlikely but also potentially a tumor. We do see fluid behind the knee, however, there are no other masses visible. He is quite distressed by how the events have affected his life and would like to have answers as soon as possible. We believe it is sensible to proceed with a left lower extremity angiogram using provocative maneuvers to see if we can identify potential vascular causes of his bleeding episodes. We will schedule this as soon as possible, potentially as soon as this Thursday, and we will be in touch with our findings.     Thank you very much for referring Mr. Regan to our Vascular Surgery Clinic, and please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions or concerns.

Unfortunately, his left knee, done by Dr. Kyler Samtani in 2008, continues to have recurrent hemarthrosis.  He has had this aspirated 3 times. Each time, it is 70 to 80 mL of frank blood. He does not feel he is doing anything excessive, and these are spontaneous bleeds.     Today, he has a 2+ fluid swelling in his left knee, but it is not warm. His left knee ranges from 0 to 90 degrees and is mildly painful globally. No change in sciatic or femoral nerve function. His right knee extends fully, bends to 110 degrees, and is stable. Sciatic and femoral nerve, normal.     His radiographs show both knees in good position.    Impression: This patient has had recurrent hemarthrosis on the left. Although he has very mild flexion instability, I do not feel that this is gross enough to revise. I am going to ask Dr. Arron Joffe of Vascular Surgery to kindly weight in on this and investigate the recurrent hemarthroses further. I will see the patient thereafter.

The studies were completed today, and his abdominal study shows no true abdominal aortic or any iliac arterial aneurysms. He has no significant plaque as well. I reassured him of these findings. His carotid duplex study showed no evidence for any hemodynamically significant stenosis, but he does have some ectasia of the subclavian arteries bilaterally that is of no concern at this point in time.     I do recommend a followup study to see if there is any progression of these ectatic segments into true aneurysms, and I have told Novikov we will have him back in 6 months for a followup duplex ultrasound. There is no reason he should not proceed with his left knee surgery as planned. All his questions were answered.     Thanks again for allowing us to participate in his care.

Apparently there is a family history of aneurysms. A paternal grandfather had what appears to have been an aneurysm, and his father had a symptomatic pararenal aneurysm that was fixed successfully, and he died of other causes.     Devore himself has never been a smoker and has no knowledge of any aneurysmal disease. He has undergone previous robotic prostatectomy without any documentation of any aneurysms at that time. He has also had episodes of recurrent pneumonia requiring prolonged treatment and followup CT scans with no recall of any thoracic aneurysms identified. There is also a family history of some cerebrovascular occlusive disease, and he has never had a carotid duplex study. He has no symptoms of TIA or amaurosis fugax. He does have a history of hyperlipidemia and he does take a statin.     His orthopedic surgery is well known to you. He has had right and left total knee arthroplasties, the right initially in 2006, the left in 2008. You revised his right total knee arthroplasty back in 2010, with a good result, and he was doing well until this April, when he developed what he describes as a somewhat spontaneous swelling in his left knee. He presented to his local physician, who performed an aspiration with drainage of 70 mL of what appeared to be hemorrhagic fluid. He felt better, and then 10 days later had recurrence of the swelling. Again 70 mL of a hemorrhagic appearing fluid was noted, and again did well for 6 days, when he had  again another episode and yet 1 more aspiration of another 70 mL of fluid. He did well and then had recurrent swelling, but no additional aspirations.     He was seen by you in early May, at which point he was referred to our Vascular Clinic where my associate, Ethel Koelbel, saw him. We discussed his case and recommended an arteriogram. Dr. Drummond took him to the Cath Lab on 05/07/2024, where there was a hyperemic blush noted along the posterior capsule of the knee joint. She isolated this to a branch of one of the superior geniculates, and successfully coil embolized this segment and completion angiograms had greatly diminished the blushing identified, and there was only early refilling of the venous in a natural pattern. She was pleased with the procedure, as was the patient, but then he had additional leg swelling 5 days later, with no additional aspirations, and continues to have some swelling in the joint.     I understand he has seen you and discussed the option of a synovectomy, which I believe is appropriate. As you and I have noticed in the past, we have had some success with treatment of these geniculate branches with diminishing the blood supply to these hyperemic capsules, but in some situations it has been unsuccessful, as with Shakoor. We discussed the potential that this was some sort of a vasculogenic problem, which I do not believe it is. I reviewed Dr. Ellerin's notes, and there was no evidence for any significant bleeding from the other geniculate vessels. The genicular pattern appeared normal. She had multiple views of the popliteal artery that adequately identified all the branches of the potential bleeding sources. Furthermore, in reviewing the note from Abboud's sister, Blass, I do not believe a CT angiogram would be helpful due to the scatter from the total knee joint.     We had a long discussion regarding his recurrent hemarthrosis, and I have recommended that Backes proceed with your plan for  synovectomy and replacement of his spacer, as these do wear down over time and may cause a micro-inflammatory response. As for his concerns for aneurysmal disease, I have scheduled him for an aortic duplex ultrasound, as well as a carotid duplex ultrasound, within the next several weeks, but I have told him I would not delay his knee surgery for the completion of these studies. I did review available imaging on his Stanford records, and his CT of the thorax in 09/11/2016 did not identify any thoracic aortic aneurysm, but did show some calcific change within the aortic wall.     All his questions were answered. I will set him up for his abdominal as well as carotid duplex studies, and we will meet again and discuss the results. Thanks again for allowing me to participate in his care.

Recall that I met him following his total knee arthroplasties, as he had an angiographic procedure to try and help with some recurrent hemarthrosis by my associate, Dr. Alice Duong. He was concerned over a family history of aneurysms and wanted to have an abdominal duplex done, which was done 1 year ago and was normal with no sign of any aneurysmal change in the iliacs or his aorta in the infrarenal position. We did also perform a carotid duplex at that time, and it just showed the plaque within the carotid bifurcation, but no velocity disturbances. He returns today for a followup with no new symptoms of amaurosis fugax or transient ischemia. He continues to work out vigorously 3 times per week and showed me some data from his workouts and his heart rate. He, in fact, rode his bike to his clinic appointment today. His carotid duplex today is unchanged from that of a year ago. Again, there was some mild plaque within the carotid bifurcation, but no evidence for any hemodynamically significant stenosis. Based on his lifestyle, his limited plaque burden at this point in time, and his age, I do not believe additional followup is necessary. Should he have a new onset of TIA or amaurosis fugax symptoms, we went over today, he will contact us directly. Otherwise, we will see him back on a p.r.n. basis.     Thanks again for allowing us to participate in his care.

He was seen by Noonan last week for acute swelling in his knee without any trauma, or other incident that he suspects. The knee, that is the left non-revised one, was swollen, but not excessively warm. It was very painful. It was aspirated, and the ESR was 2, CRP less than 0.2, negative culture, negative alpha-defensin, red blood cells almost 3 million cell count, 1333 white blood cells. Neutrophils were 50%. It seems as though the patient had some sort of bleeding episode into the knee. He is not on any anticoagulants and did not bump his knee or injure it.     He did well for a few days, but then his knee became more painful and more swollen within the last few days. He has had no systemic symptoms otherwise.     He is active and works out at a gym.     Today, his hip is mobile, left side. His knee has a large effusion that is not warm. Range 0 to 110 degrees, no instability in flexion or extension, sciatic or femoral nerve no change.     His radiographs show no fractures and no other issues with regard to the knee replacement.     At this point, we do not think his knee is infected, but he may have torn a synovial piece. We will aspirate it again today at his request and cover the knee with a compressive bandage. We will have him back off from activities and get gentle physical therapy to decrease the swelling and increase his strength.

Pre-Medication:  · Amoxicillin 2g 1 hour prior to procedure.  · If patient is allergic to Penicillin, give Clindamycin 600mg 1 hour prior to procedure    NOTE:  This is for patients post joint replacement surgery having simple dental cleaning or minor procedures. More extensive dental procedures may require different or longer antibiotic  coverage.  ______________________________________________________________________    Pre-Operative Antimicrobial (Chlorhexidine Gluconate)  Bathing/Showering Instructions Using CHG Surgical Scrub Sponge  Patient Education   What You Should Know:  Before surgery, you can play an important role in your own health. Because skin is not sterile, we need to be sure that your skin is as free of germs as possible before surgery. You can reduce the number of germs on your skin by following these instructions   IMPORTANT: You will be bathing/showering with a special soap called chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG). *Not to be used by people allergic to chlorhexidine.    Instructions:  Shower or bathe with CHG two times before surgery -- the night before your surgery AND the morning of your surgery.   Apply the CHG soap (sponge side of applicator) to your entire body ONLY FROM THE NECK DOWN. Do not use CHG near your eyes or ears to avoid permanent injury to those areas. Wash thoroughly, using the sponge as you would a bar of soap. Make sure to wash the area where your surgery will be performed.   Do not use the CHG sponge on your genital area. You may use your regular bath soap for this area.   Do not wash with your regular soap after CHG is used.  Do not shave the area of your body where your surgery will be performed or scrub your skin too hard. This can lead to small cuts that can allow germs to enter the body.   Rinse your body thoroughly.   Ortiz yourself dry with a clean, soft towel.      **You will be contacted by the anesthesia nurse practitioner with time of surgery the day before your surgery.**      "

An overdose of numbing medicine can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin.   Do not use large amounts of lidocaine topical, or cover treated skin areas with a bandage or plastic wrap without medical advice.  Keep both used and unused lidocaine skin patches out of the reach of children or pets. The amount of lidocaine in the skin patches could be harmful to a child or pet who accidentally sucks on or swallows the patch.  What is lidocaine topical?  Lidocaine is a local anesthetic (numbing medication). It works by blocking nerve signals in your body.  Lidocaine topical (for use on the skin) is used to reduce pain or discomfort caused by skin irritations such as sunburn, insect bites, poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, and minor cuts, scratches, or burns. Lidocaine topical is also used to treat rectal discomfort caused by hemorrhoids.  Lidocaine topical may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.  What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before using lidocaine topical?  You should not use lidocaine topical if you are allergic to any type of numbing medicine.  Fatal overdoses have occurred when numbing medicines were used without the advice of a medical doctor (such as during a cosmetic procedure like laser hair removal). However, overdose has also occurred in women treated with a numbing medicine before having a mammography.  Be aware that many cosmetic procedures are performed without a medical doctor present.  Tell your doctor if you have ever had:  · liver disease; or  · if you take a heart rhythm medicine.  Lidocaine topical is not expected to harm  an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant.  If you apply lidocaine topical to your chest, avoid areas that may come into contact with the baby's mouth.  How should I use lidocaine topical?  Use this medicine exactly as directed on the label, or as it has been prescribed by your doctor. Do not apply this medicine in larger amounts than recommended.  Improper use of lidocaine topical may result in death.   Lidocaine topical comes in many different forms (gel, spray, cream, lotion, ointment, liquid, skin patch).  Do not take by mouth. Topical medicine is for use only on the skin. If this medicine gets in your eyes, nose, mouth, rectum, or vagina, rinse with water.   Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided with your medicine. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions.  Use the smallest amount of medicine needed to numb the skin or relieve pain. Your body may absorb too much of this medicine if you use too much, if you apply it over large skin areas, or if you apply heat, bandages, or plastic wrap to treated skin areas. Skin that is cut or irritated may also absorb more topical medication than healthy skin.  Do not apply this medicine to swollen skin areas or deep puncture wounds. Avoid using the medicine on skin that is raw or blistered, such as a severe burn or abrasion.  Do not cover treated skin unless your doctor has told you to.   Lidocaine topical may be applied with your finger tips or a cotton swab.  Store at room temperature away from moisture and heat.  Keep both used and unused lidocaine topical skin patches out of the reach of children or pets. The amount of lidocaine in the skin patches could be harmful to a child or pet who accidentally sucks on or swallows the patch. Seek emergency medical attention if this happens.  What happens if I miss a dose?  Since lidocaine topical is used when needed, you may not be on a dosing schedule. Skip any  missed dose if it's almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.  What happens if I overdose?  Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-999-999-9999.  An overdose of numbing medicine can cause fatal side effects if too much of the medicine is absorbed through your skin and into your blood. Overdose symptoms may include uneven heartbeats, seizure (convulsions), slowed breathing, coma, or respiratory failure (breathing stops).  Lidocaine applied to the skin is not likely to cause an overdose unless you apply more than the recommended dose.  What should I avoid while using lidocaine topical?  Do not allow this medicine to come into contact with your eyes. If it does, rinse with water.  Avoid touching the sticky side of a lidocaine skin patch while applying it.  Avoid accidentally injuring treated skin areas while they are numb. Avoid coming into contact with very hot or very cold surfaces.  What are the possible side effects of lidocaine topical?  Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction:  hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.  Call your doctor at once if you have:  · severe burning, stinging, or irritation where the medicine was applied;  · swelling or redness;  · sudden dizziness or drowsiness after medicine is applied;  · confusion, blurred vision, ringing in your ears; or  · unusual sensations of temperature.  Common side effects include:  · mild irritation where the medication is applied; or  · numbness in places where the medicine is accidentally applied.  This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.  What other drugs will affect lidocaine topical?  Medicine used on the skin is not likely to be affected by other drugs you use. But many drugs can interact with each other.  Tell each of your health care providers about all medicines you use, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products.  Where can I get more information?  Your pharmacist has information about lidocaine topical.  Remember, keep this and all other medicines out of the reach of children, never share your medicines with others, and use this medication only for the indication prescribed.

MISUSE OF OPIOID MEDICINE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it.  Taking opioid medicine during pregnancy may cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.   Fatal side effects can occur if you use opioid medicine with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.   What is oxycodone?  Oxycodone is an opioid pain medication used to treat moderate to severe pain.  The extended-release form of oxycodone is for around-the-clock treatment of pain and should not  be used on an as-needed basis for pain.  Oxycodone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.  What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before using oxycodone?  You should not use oxycodone if you are allergic to it, or if you have:  · severe asthma or breathing problems; or  · a blockage in your stomach or intestines.  You should not use oxycodone unless you are already using a similar opioid medicine and are tolerant to it.   Most brands of oxycodone are not approved for use in people under 18. OxyContin should not be given to a child younger than 11 years old.  Tell your doctor if you have ever had:  · breathing problems, sleep apnea;  · a head injury, or seizures;  · drug or alcohol addiction, or mental illness;  · liver or kidney disease;  · urination problems; or  · problems with your gallbladder, pancreas, or thyroid.  If you use opioid  medicine while you are pregnant, your baby could become dependent on the drug. This can cause life-threatening withdrawal symptoms in the baby after it is born. Babies born dependent on opioids may need medical treatment for several weeks.  Do not breast-feed. Oxycodone can pass into breast milk and may cause drowsiness, breathing problems, or death in a nursing baby.  How should I use oxycodone?  Follow the directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides. Never use oxycodone in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Tell your doctor if you feel an increased urge to take more of this medicine.  Never share opioid medicine with another person, especially someone with a history of drug abuse or addiction. MISUSE CAN CAUSE ADDICTION, OVERDOSE, OR DEATH. Keep the medication in a place where others cannot get to it. Selling or giving away opioid medicine is against the law.  Stop taking all other around-the-clock narcotic pain medicines when you start taking extended-release oxycodone.  Take oxycodone with food.  Swallow the capsule or tablet whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal overdose. Do not crush, chew, break, open, or dissolve.  Never crush or break an oxycodone pill to inhale the powder or mix it into a liquid to inject the drug into your vein. This can cause in death.  Measure liquid medicine carefully. Use the dosing syringe provided, or use a medicine dose-measuring device (not a kitchen spoon).  You should not stop using oxycodone suddenly. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.  Store at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and light. Keep track of your medicine. Oxycodone is a drug of abuse and you should be aware if anyone is using your medicine improperly or without a prescription.  Do not keep leftover opioid medication. Just one dose can cause death in someone using this medicine accidentally or improperly.  Ask your pharmacist where to  locate a drug take-back disposal program. If there is no take-back program, flush the unused medicine down the toilet.  What happens if I miss a dose?  Since oxycodone is used for pain, you are not likely to miss a dose. Skip any missed dose if it is almost time for your next dose. Do not use two doses at one time.  What happens if I overdose?  Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-999-999-9999. An oxycodone overdose can be fatal, especially in a child or other person using the medicine without a prescription.  Overdose can cause severe muscle weakness, pinpoint pupils, very slow breathing, extreme drowsiness, or coma.  What should I avoid while using oxycodone?  Do not drink alcohol. Dangerous side effects or death could occur.  Avoid driving or operating machinery until you know how oxycodone will affect you. Dizziness or severe drowsiness can cause falls or other accidents.  Avoid medication errors. Always check the brand and strength of oxycodone you get from the pharmacy.  What are the possible side effects of oxycodone?  Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.  Opioid medicine can slow or stop your breathing, and death may occur. A person caring for you should seek emergency medical attention if you have slow breathing with long pauses, blue colored lips, or if you are hard to wake up.  Call your doctor at once if you have:  · noisy breathing, sighing, shallow breathing, breathing that stops during sleep;  · a slow heart rate or weak pulse;  · a light-headed feeling, like you might pass out;  · confusion, unusual thoughts or behavior;  · seizure (convulsions); or  · low cortisol levels -- nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dizziness, worsening tiredness or weakness.  Seek medical attention right away if you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, such as: agitation, confusion,  fever, sweating, fast heart rate, chest pain, feeling short of breath, muscle stiffness, trouble walking, or feeling faint.  Serious side effects may be more likely in older adults and those who are malnourished or debilitated.   Long-term use of opioid medication may affect fertility (ability to have children) in men or women. It is not known whether opioid effects on fertility are permanent.  Common side effects may include:  · drowsiness, headache, dizziness, tiredness; or  · constipation, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting.  This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.  What other drugs will affect oxycodone?  You may have breathing problems or withdrawal symptoms if you start or stop taking certain other medicines. Tell your doctor if you also use an antibiotic, antifungal medication, heart or blood pressure medication, seizure medication, or medicine to treat HIV or hepatitis C.  Opioid medication can interact with many other drugs and cause dangerous side effects or death. Be sure your doctor knows if you also use:  · cold or allergy medicines, bronchodilator asthma/COPD medication, or a diuretic (""water pill"");  · medicines for motion sickness, irritable bowel syndrome, or overactive bladder;  · other narcotic medications --opioid pain medicine or prescription cough medicine;  · a sedative like Valium --diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, Xanax, Klonopin, Versed, and others;  · drugs that make you sleepy or slow your breathing --a sleeping pill, muscle relaxer, medicine to treat mood disorders or mental illness; or  · drugs that affect serotonin levels in your body --a stimulant, or medicine for depression, Parkinson's disease, migraine headaches, serious infections, or nausea and vomiting.  This list is not complete and many other drugs may affect oxycodone. This includes prescription  and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Not all possible drug interactions are listed here.  Where can I get more information?  Your pharmacist can provide more information about oxycodone.

Some people have thoughts about suicide while taking this medicine. Children taking gabapentin may have behavior changes. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor.  Do not stop using gabapentin suddenly, even if you feel fine.  What is gabapentin?  Gabapentin is an anti-epileptic drug, also called an anticonvulsant. It affects chemicals and nerves in the body that are involved in the cause of seizures and some types of pain.  Gabapentin is used in adults to treat nerve pain caused by herpes virus or shingles (herpes zoster).  The Horizant brand of gabapentin is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS).  The Neurontin brand of gabapentin is also used to treat seizures in adults and children who are at least 3 years old.  Use only the brand and form of gabapentin your doctor has prescribed.  Check your medicine each time you get a refill to make sure you receive the correct form.  Gabapentin may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.  What should I discuss with my healthcare provider before taking gabapentin?  You should not use gabapentin if you are allergic to it.  To make sure gabapentin is safe for you, tell your doctor if you have ever had:  · kidney disease (or if you are on dialysis);  · diabetes;  · depression, a mood disorder, or suicidal thoughts or actions;  · a seizure (unless you take gabapentin to treat seizures);  · liver disease;  · heart disease; or  · (for patients with RLS) if you are a  day sleeper or work a night shift.  Some people have thoughts about suicide while taking this medicine. Your doctor should check your progress at regular visits. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.  It is not known whether this medicine will harm an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.  Seizure control is very important during pregnancy, and having a seizure could harm both mother and baby. Do not start or stop taking gabapentin for seizures without your doctor's advice, and tell your doctor right away if you become pregnant.  Gabapentin can pass into breast milk, but effects on the nursing baby are not known. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding.  How should I take gabapentin?  Follow all directions on your prescription label. Do not take this medicine in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended.  The Horizant brand of gabapentin should not be taken during the day. For best results, take Pulsifer with food at about 5:00 in the evening.  Both Hubbell and Rose should be taken with food.  Neurontin can be taken with or without food.  If you break a Neurontin tablet and take only half of it, take the other half at your next dose. Any tablet that has been broken should be used as soon as possible or within a few days.  Do not crush, chew, or break an extended-release tablet. Swallow it whole.  Measure liquid medicine with the dosing syringe provided, or with a special dose-measuring spoon or medicine cup. If you do not have a dose-measuring device, ask your pharmacist for one.  If your doctor changes your brand, strength, or type of gabapentin, your dosage needs may change.  Ask your pharmacist if you have any questions about the new kind of gabapentin you receive at the pharmacy.  Do not stop using gabapentin suddenly, even if you feel fine. Stopping suddenly may cause increased seizures. Follow your  doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.  Wear a medical alert tag or carry an ID card stating that you have seizures. Any medical care provider who treats you should know that you take seizure medication.  This medicine can cause unusual results with certain medical tests. Tell any doctor who treats you that you are using gabapentin.  Store gabapentin tablets and capsules at room temperature away from light and moisture.  Store the liquid medicine in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.  What happens if I miss a dose?  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember. Be sure to take the medicine with food. Skip the missed dose if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.  What happens if I overdose?  Seek emergency medical attention or call the Poison Help line at 1-999-999-9999.  What should I avoid while taking gabapentin?  This medicine may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be alert.  Avoid taking an antacid within 2 hours before or after you take gabapentin. Antacids can make it harder for your body to absorb gabapentin.  Drinking alcohol with this medicine can cause side effects.  What are the possible side effects of gabapentin?  Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.  Seek medical treatment if you have a serious drug reaction that can affect many parts of your body. Symptoms may include: skin rash, fever, swollen glands, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches, severe weakness, unusual bruising, or yellowing of your skin or eyes. This reaction may occur several weeks after you began using gabapentin.  Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor, such as: mood or behavior changes, anxiety, panic attacks, trouble sleeping, or if you feel impulsive, irritable, agitated, hostile,  aggressive, restless, hyperactive (mentally or physically), depressed, or have thoughts about suicide or hurting yourself.  Call your doctor at once if you have:  · increased seizures;  · severe weakness or tiredness;  · problems with balance or muscle movement;  · upper stomach pain;  · chest pain, new or worsening cough with fever, trouble breathing;  · severe tingling or numbness;  · rapid eye movement; or  · kidney problems --little or no urination, painful or difficult urination, swelling in your feet or ankles.

Common side effects may include:  · headache, dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness;  · swelling in your hands or feet;  · problems with your eyes;  · coordination problems; or  · (in children) fever, nausea, vomiting.  This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

You should not use acetaminophen if you have severe liver disease.  Use this medicine exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor.

Broken Rib: Care Instructions  Your Care Instructions    A broken rib is a crack or break in one of the bones of the rib cage. Breathing can be very painful because the muscles used for breathing pull on the rib.  In most cases, a broken rib will heal on its own. You can take pain medicine while the rib mends. Pain relief allows you to take deep breaths. In the past, doctors recommended taping or wrapping broken ribs. This is no longer done because taping makes it hard for you to take deep breaths. Taking deep breaths may help prevent pneumonia or a partial collapse of a lung.  Your rib will heal in about 6 weeks.  You heal best when you take good care of yourself. Eat a variety of healthy foods, and don't smoke.  Follow-up care is a key part of your treatment and safety. Be sure to make and go to all appointments, and call your doctor if you are having problems. It's also a good idea to know your test results and keep a list of the medicines you take.  How can you care for yourself at home?  · Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label.  ? If the doctor gave you a prescription medicine for pain, take it as prescribed.  ? If you are not taking a prescription pain medicine, ask your doctor if you can take an over-the-counter medicine.  · Even if it hurts, try to cough or take the deepest breath you can at least once every hour. This will get air deeply into your lungs. This may reduce your chance of getting pneumonia or a partial collapse of a lung. Hold  a pillow against your chest to make this less painful.  · Put ice or a cold pack on the area for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Put a thin cloth between the ice and your skin.  When should you call for help?   Call 911 anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if:    · You have severe trouble breathing.     Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if:    · You have some trouble breathing.     · You have a fever.     · You have a new or worse cough.    Watch closely for changes in your health, and be sure to contact your doctor if:    · You have pain even after taking your medicine.     · You do not get better as expected.
